Right.<$FFFE>
Sorry, sorry.<$FFFC>
I didn't mean it; I just wanted to see you smile.<$FFFD>
I don't know if you've realized it yet, but your smile is what dispels my doubts and sets me at ease.<$FFFE>
Y..you can't mean.....<$FFFE>
Don't worry.<$FFFC>
We'll win for sure.<$FFFE>
R..right......<$FFFE>
