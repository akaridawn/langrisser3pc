Charge!<$FFFC>
We will reclaim our country!<$FFFE>
Ohhhh!!<$FFFE>
They show such passion.<$FFFC>
With such a display, we should be fine.<$FFFE>
Indeed.<$FFFE>
If we retake the royal capitol at the same time the mobile division retakes Laffel, we'll have control of the two largest cities.<$FFFE>
That would be a huge step towards reclaiming our kingdom.<$FFFE>
....Sir Kirikaze.<$FFFC>
Will you aid me now in our struggle to reclaim our kingdom?<$FFFE>
It would be my pleasure.<$FFFE>
After all, I cannot accept death until I have defeated the spectral sorceress who destroyed my homeland.<$FFFE>
But, before I pursue my vendetta, I shall offer my service in driving out the Imperials.<$FFFC>
If you will excuse me?<$FFFE>
Make way!<$FFFE>
Though I hail from a foreign land, for now I am pledged to the cause of Larcuss!<$FFFC>
My name is Kirikaze!<$FFFE>
Come forth if you dare accept my challenge!<$FFFE>
General Bortz.<$FFFC>
Their forces seem invigorated; I have this feeling we're about to be routed!<$FFFE>
I'd expect nothing less from Lord Raymond.<$FFFC>
He might even be able to corner me.<$FFFE>
But, don't worry!<$FFFC>
General Gaiel should be bringing relief forces shortly.<$FFFE>
I see, now.<$FFFC>
The General doesn't seem disturbed in the slightest in the face of this adversity.<$FFFE>
Given that, we'll fight with our spirits high until those relief troops arrive!<$FFFE>
<$FFFF>
