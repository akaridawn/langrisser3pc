Plains of Luon ~ Marshlands<$FFFF>
This place is just perfect for an ambush, I can already smell the scent of carnage in the air.<$FFFE>
...But waiting is so unnerving.<$FFFC>
If we get rid of them here, surely Master Böser would be very pleased.<$FFFE>
Lady Ferakia.<$FFFC>
The smell of humans is becoming strong.<$FFFE>
They are approaching.<$FFFC>
Now my little darlings, do me a favor and don't mess this up.<$FFFE>
We won't fail you.<$FFFE>
The scouts have reported sightings of demons around here.<$FFFE>
Undoubtedly...<$FFFC>
The presence of demons can be felt all around.<$FFFE>
So here it will be then.<$FFFE>
....This time I will bring a conclusion!<$FFFE>
Everyone, stay alert!<$FFFE>
You bet!<$FFFE>
GIGIGI!<$FFFE>
Blasted!<$FFFC>
Enemies are attacking from behind!?<$FFFE>
Hahahah!<$FFFC>
Let the bloodbath begin!<$FFFC>
Make sure our honored guests enjoy themselves to the fullest!<$FFFE>
The frozen ground is rather hard to tread on.<$FFFE>
Yes.<$FFFC>
Furthermore our overland units are handicapped because there's only a narrow path.<$FFFD>
It would be advisable to deploy fLying and naval units to wipe out the enemy's ranged units.<$FFFE>
You must be pretty carefree or simply stupid to think you can venture into our territory like this.<$FFFE>
Spare us the act, for the time of your death draws near!<$FFFE>
Spare us the act, for the time of your death draws near!<$FFFE>
Coincidently this crystal here has the convenient property to enhance my magic tenfold.<$FFFD>
Today you'll witness my less timid side.<$FFFC>
You should consider yourselves lucky, not many are blessed with so much of my loving attention.<$FFFE>
I can't wait to try out this body!<$FFFC>
Here I come!<$FFFE>
Tss!<$FFFC>
Here you are already; you're quiet a dashing one!<$FFFE>
It's time to settle this once and for all!<$FFFC>
The Shinigami eagerly await the offering of your life!<$FFFE>
If you want to end your misery so badly, come right at me!<$FFFC>
This time I won't let you off the hook that easily!<$FFFE>
Why did it have to end like this...<$FFFE>
I'm sorry....<$FFFC>
Sir Diehärte...<$FFFE>
Father...<$FFFE>
Coty....<$FFFE>
Farewell everyone...<$FFFC>
I'm so tired...<$FFFE>
Aaah...<$FFFE>
Sir Diehärte....<$FFFE>
That light...is so...warm...<$FFFE>
Sophia...<$FFFE>
Grrr...<$FFFE>
Dammit, I failed!<$FFFE>
This could have been avoided...<$FFFE>
Aaaahh, the blue sky...<$FFFE>
I've got no regrets...<$FFFC>
I can't sense the enemy...anymore...<$FFFE>
<$F702><$F702>Lord Kirikaze...<$FFFE>
You...morons...<$FFFC>
This...is not..the end...<$FFFE>
Forgive me Lord Böser...I have failed...<$FFFC>
..I'll be watching...you...from Oblivion...my ill-mannered darlings..<$FFFE>
My lord....your murder has been indemnified...<$FFFE>
My lord....your murder has been indemnified...<$FFFE>
...<$FFFE>
You did well, Sir Diehärte. Today we have won an important victory.<$FFFE>
Sir Diehärte....<$FFFC>
I know this was a difficult battle...<$FFFD>
So this time I'll let it slide...<$FFFE>
Hmm, a strange doll flew by...<$FFFC>
I wonder what was that all about...<$FFFE>
Right now those demons need to be purged!<$FFFC>
Be prepared!<$FFFE>
Ouch...<$FFFC>
You naughty little human!<$FFFE>
I have been honorably defeated!<$FFFC>
I recognize your greatness!<$FFFE>
How laughable...<$FFFE>
GUUGAAAA!<$FFFE>
GUUGAAAA!<$FFFE>
Uarggh!<$FFFE>
Such cruelty...<$FFFE>
You cretins won't trample on our land unpunished!<$FFFE>
It shouldn't be...<$FFFC>
me...whose...dying...<$FFFE>
You morons!<$FFFC>
You came all the way just to die!<$FFFE>
Uuugh....<$FFFC>
I'm dreaming of a world of pure darkness...<$FFFE>
I may die now....<$FFFE>
It's time to...let go...<$FFFE>
GOOOON!<$FFFE>
GOOOON!<$FFFE>
GOOOON!<$FFFE>
GUGAAAAA!<$FFFE>
I cannot stand this world anymore....<$FFFE>
So far...so good...<$FFFE>
Later...<$FFFD>
Guaaargh!<$FFFE>
GAAAAA!<$FFFE>
Atone!...<$FFFE>
Lord...Chaos<$FFFE>
SYUUH!<$FFFE>
You hurt my feelings...mostly...<$FFFE>
Uwaaaaah!<$FFFE>
SYUUHH!<$FFFE>
GURRR....<$FFFE>
GUURRR...<$FFFE>
You are the only one left.<$FFFC>
Resign yourself.<$FFFE>
Give yourself up Ferakia, all your troops has been wiped out!<$FFFE>
Hmmph!<$FFFC>
What use would that have if you'd kill me anyway!?<$FFFE>
You're doing quiet well, for humans.<$FFFE>
To reward your many efforts I will show you the true extent of my beauty!<$FFFE>
What!?<$FFFE>
Watch closely!<$FFFE>
I wonder how she did this?<$FFFC>
What kind of peculiar magic is that?<$FFFE>
Hahaha!<$FFFE>
Now that I have taken this form, all hope for you has dwindled!<$FFFE>
No matter what monstrosity you turn into, I will deliver you to justice all the same!<$FFFE>
Be my guest and witness this body's disastrous power with your own flesh!<$FFFE>
This time you can't run away!<$FFFC>
At long last I will avenge my Lord's murder, so my anguish will be soothed!<$FFFE>
Hmph!<$FFFC>
Don't get your hopes up.<$FFFC>
Once I've sent you to hell you're torment will continue for eternity! <$FFFE>
You come across a blue glowing round object.<$FFFE>
What do you do?<$FFFE>
Do your favorite pose<$FFFE>
Smile at it<$FFFE>
Watch it<$FFFE>
The head of a terracotta doll was obtained!<$FFFD>
A terracotta head shots out and flies laughingly through the sky until it's out of sight...<$FFFE>
....<$FFFC>
You are invited to make a weird pose...<$FFFD>
But you couldn't do it!<$FFFE>
You come across a strangely glowing shard-like object.<$FFFE>
What do you do?<$FFFE>
Punch it<$FFFE>
Do nothing<$FFFE>
Dance around<$FFFE>
You smashed it to pieces...<$FFFE>
The object remained in the snow...<$FFFE>
A blue shard jumped into your hand!<$FFFD>
Fragment of the doll was obtained!<$FFFE>
You come across a strangely glowing shard-like object.<$FFFE>
What do you do?<$FFFE>
Try touching it<$FFFE>
Pay your respects<$FFFE>
Spit on it<$FFFE>
The moment you bow down to get the shard, it comes out of the snow by itself!<$FFFE>
The blue shard jumped right into your hand!<$FFFD>
Fragment of the doll was obtained!<$FFFE>
Upon carrying out your plan,<$FFFD>
the shard dissolved...<$FFFE>
You are in possession of the dolls head!<$FFFD>
But major parts of it's body are still missing!<$FFFE>
The doll gives you feelings of unrest...<$FFFC>
Frustrated you throw it away!<$FFFE>
Suddenly the face of the doll turns to you!<$FFFD>
As it dances in mid-air, it gives off an eerie laughter and begins talking :<$FFFE>
Come Diehärte, there's a place you must see!<$FFFD>
What's going on now?<$FFFE>
Umm...<$FFFC>
Was it not you who gathered my body?<$FFFE>
Uh huh.<$FFFE>
So you must like dolls.<$FFFC>
On the other hand you must hate me somehow, or you wouldn't have thrown me away!<$FFFE>
HAHAHAHAHA!<$FFFC>
Anyway, let's be on our way!<$FFFC>
But wait, there are still enemies you need to take care of, no?<$FFFE>
<$FFFF>
