Geriord.....<$FFFE>
Miss Layla..<$FFFE>
Excuse me...<$FFFC>
I'm going to look for Geriord!<$FFFE>
Well, it looks like the strategy worked.<$FFFD>
Now, if Lord Raymond.....<$FFFE>
Mr. Kirikaze!<$FFFE>
..I have failed.....<$FFFD>
The Empire's mechanical soldier somehow managed to decimate our main troops.<$FFFE>
What about Father!?<$FFFE>
My humble apologies.<$FFFC>
We were separated on the way back, and I don't know what happened to him.....<$FFFE>
He might have been captured by the enemy.<$FFFE>
I'll have my people look into that possibility and find what news they can.<$FFFE>
Thanks, Wolf.<$FFFD>
Sophia, escort Kirikaze to the church.<$FFFE>
Certainly.<$FFFE>
I'll come and help, too.<$FFFE>
At any rate, these circumstances change things; we need to finish up right away and hurry on to Larcussia!<$FFFE>
Near Fort Rogier<$FFFF>
Are you all right, Princess?<$FFFE>
...Huh?<$FFFC>
What happened?<$FFFE>
My apologies.<$FFFC>
It seems we weren't strong enough, as always.....<$FFFE>
What are you talking about.<$FFFC>
You all did very well.<$FFFD>
I take full responsibility for this failure.<$FFFE>
Princess.....<$FFFE>
Supreme Commander Dark Knight.....<$FFFE>
How could this be?<$FFFC>
What is the meaning of this?<$FFFE>
They retook Laffel....<$FFFD>
If you must ask, it was solely my weakness which has left us with only these troops remaining.<$FFFD>
It is entirely my fault.<$FFFE>
Princess....<$FFFE>
What do you say, Dark Knight?<$FFFC>
Will you insult me and call me an incompetent?<$FFFE>
......Their power has definitely grown.<$FFFD>
There was nothing we could have done this time.<$FFFE>
........<$FFFD>
It was my fault that troops were sent away on the enemy's wild goose chase.<$FFFD>
It would have been quite difficult to stop those foes with the troops I had left behind.<$FFFE>
Dark Knight....<$FFFE>
No matter who's at fault, if this is all the military might we can muster at present, we will have to return to our homeland.<$FFFD>
Until the soldiers are prepared, we won't be able to invade Larcuss.....<$FFFE>
I see.<$FFFC>
All units, withdraw and return to our homeland.<$FFFE>
Velzeria Castle<$FFFF>
So Barral was defeated that quickly.....<$FFFC>
This is quite unexpected><$FFFE>
However, the main body of Larcuss troops was annihilated by the Empire.<$FFFE>
Our only remaining obstacle now is the Empire.<$FFFC>
However, the Empire's power has further increased as a result.<$FFFE>
.....No, I wouldn't call them an obstacle, since I've got word that the Empire's military might has been exhausted as well.<$FFFE>
So all that remains of Larcuss is [diehardt's name] and his mobile division, eh.  I wonder if they will fight against the Empire.<$FFFE>
But regardless, if the two fight, their armies will be even more greatly diminished.<$FFFC>
So, when they've fought it out, that would be a perfect opportunity for us.....<$FFFE>
Grove.<$FFFC>
How goes the assassination of Altem¸ller?<$FFFE>
We've captured the younger sister of one of the Imperial Generals.<$FFFC>
At present, we are using her as leverage.<$FFFE>
I see.....<$FFFC>
Wahahahahaha!<$FFFE>
<$FFFF>
