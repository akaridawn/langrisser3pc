*Sigh*...<$FFFC>
It doesn't bode well, for the Dark Knight being called off like that.<$FFFE>
The ones attempting to capture Rogier must be pretty bold.<$FFFC>
That fortress alone is enough to withstand an army.<$FFFE>
I bet the Dark Knight has sent them all off to the Netherworld by now.<$FFFE>
I'm well aware of what the Dark Knight is capable of. But growing overly confident could easily be ones downfall, don't you think?<$FFFE>
Please excuse my rudeness!<$FFFC>
I was just thinking out loud.<$FFFE>
...It's alright.<$FFFC>
Speaking ones mind is something more people should be capable of.<$FFFE>
The enemy!<$FFFC>
The enemy has come!<$FFFE>
!?<$FFFE>
At long last we are back..<$FFFE>
Yeah.<$FFFC>
We have returned.<$FFFE>
Now I will prove worthy of the oath I made to Geriord!<$FFFE>
Breaking through the gates will be no easy task.<$FFFC>
But we can't turn back after coming so far.<$FFFE>
Yo!<$FFFC>
What's all this racket all about!?<$FFFE>
Wolf!?<$FFFE>
You know, I'm drawn to wherever the action is.<$FFFC>
Besides I couldn't tolerate any battle in my town that I'm not involved in<$FFFE>
Rejoice, the legendary Silver Wolf is here to save the day!<$FFFC>
Just give me some orders.<$FFFE>
Have you come to be atone for your crimes?<$FFFC>
Traitor, Dios...<$FFFE>
Now that's a good one.<$FFFC>
Even just thinking about going back to Barral as it is now makes me sick.<$FFFC>
I'm ashamed of what has become of you.<$FFFD>
I do what I do for my sake as well as the king I served.<$FFFC>
But this king has gone completely mad and now treats human lives as if it was nothing!<$FFFE>
That's enough insulting my father!<$FFFC>
You will return if you want to or not!<$FFFE>
The western gate is under attack...<$FFFD>
1st rear guard unit!<$FFFC>
Reinforce the western gate!<$FFFE>
The enemy is making its move on the northwest gate.<$FFFC>
Attention!<$FFFE>
They'll come through the southwest gate...<$FFFD>
1st rear guard unit!<$FFFC>
Support the southwest gate!<$FFFE>
They are trying to breach the eastern gate...<$FFFD>
2nd rear guard unit!<$FFFC>
Reinforce the eastern gate!<$FFFE>
The enemy assaults the northern gate!<$FFFC>
Attention!<$FFFE>
The southern gate is under attack...<$FFFD>
2nd rear guard unit!<$FFFC>
Reinforce the southern gate!<$FFFE>
...<$FFFC>
So once again I have to fight Diehärte...<$FFFE>
All troops prepare for battle!<$FFFC>
Defend the town until the Dark Knight returns with our main force!<$FFFE>
This battle is already decided, Flaire.<$FFFC>
I don't want any more harm to come to you.<$FFFD>
Please stand down!<$FFFE>
I'm afraid that isn't possible!<$FFFC>
I've got my own position to live up to!<$FFFE>
What do you reply?<$FFFE>
Throw it away<$FFFE>
I don't understand<$FFFE>
I know something is troubling you<$FFFE>
If that position binds you and puts you into harms way you should give up on it!<$FFFD>
Before you are the Princess of Barral you are an independent woman!<$FFFE>
You don't understand me at all!<$FFFD>
I have no choice but to obey father!<$FFFE>
King Wilder has gone mad.<$FFFC>
Doing his biding any longer is madness by itself!<$FFFE>
It's true that father has changed.<$FFFC>
But his change is also my responsibility!<$FFFD>
That's why I'll never abandon him!<$FFFE>
Flaire...<$FFFE>
I don't understand you!<$FFFC>
Why are you being so repellent even though I spoke gently?<$FFFE>
That's because I'm not the kind of person that gives up on her own believes in the wink of an eye.<$FFFD>
But you're right Diehärte. You really don't understand me at all!<$FFFE>
Just what is troubling you?<$FFFD>
We always had a good relationship, right Flaire?<$FFFC>
So if something is worrying you, just tell me!<$FFFE>
Thank you, Diehärte...<$FFFD>
But it's complicated.<$FFFC>
Right now I don't know how to feel about all of this. <$FFFE>
You are worried about King Wilder, are you not?<$FFFD>
You are the person who should know best just how much he changed as of late.<$FFFE>
Father's current change is my responsibility.<$FFFD>
And that's why I can't abandon him.<$FFFC>
That's why I have to stay at fathers side no matter what.<$FFFE>
Flaire...<$FFFE>
I won't tell you anything!<$FFFE>
I won't tell you anything!<$FFFE>
A little girl opens the door for you.<$FFFE>
How do you speak with her?<$FFFE>
Joking<$FFFE>
Strict<$FFFE>
Gentle<$FFFE>
The girl smiled and went back to the inner part of the building.<$FFFE>
The girl was surprised and went back to the inner part of the building.<$FFFE>
The girl handed a beautiful ring to you.<$FFFE>
Ring of the Stone Spirit was obtained!<$FFFE>
A beautiful woman opens the door for you.<$FFFE>
How do you speak with her?<$FFFE>
Promise to liberate Laffel<$FFFE>
Glance flirtatiously<$FFFE>
Propose marriage<$FFFE>
The woman smiles at you and hands over a beautiful piece of fabric.<$FFFE>
Veil of Light was obtained!<$FFFE>
The woman yawns and closes the door.<$FFFE>
The woman laughs, shakes her head, shuts the door and you feel like an idiot.<$FFFE>
It looks like something was buried here not long ago.<$FFFE>
Do you want to dig a whole?<$FFFE>
While digging you come across a strongbox, containing a skilfully-crafted accessory.<$FFFE>
Star Coin was obtained!<$FFFE>
Don't tell me...<$FFFC>
You would let me die like this...<$FFFE>
Papa...<$FFFE>
I'm sorry, everyone...<$FFFE>
I reached my limit...<$FFFE>
It's hopeless...<$FFFE>
Huh?<$FFFE>
Excuse me...<$FFFE>
Lushiris...where are you now...<$FFFE>
Guargh...<$FFFC>
Please carry on...<$FFFE>
Urgh...<$FFFE>
How sad...<$FFFE>
Crap!<$FFFC>
Why is there a gap at the place my heart should be...<$FFFE>
Cheer up, Wolf.<$FFFC>
We depend on you.<$FFFE>
I will finish this.<$FFFC>
I'll show my friends what I'm capable of...<$FFFE>
If I'm defeated Barral will...<$FFFE>
Flaire...<$FFFE>
What do you say?<$FFFE>
We have won.<$FFFE>
Wasted efforts<$FFFE>
Why...<$FFFE>
We have won.<$FFFE>
Surely I...<$FFFE>
Your efforts are wasted.<$FFFE>
You think this battle was in vain?<$FFFC>
I give up on hoping you'll ever understand how I feel.<$FFFE>
Why are you doing this...?<$FFFE>
It's something only I can understand...<$FFFC>
If I wouldn't, Father would...<$FFFE>
Flaire...<$FFFE>
This battle seems lost.<$FFFE>
We can't take any more losses...dammit!<$FFFC>
All troops retreat!<$FFFE>
Flaire!<$FFFE>
...There she goes...<$FFFE>
You led us magnificently during this battle, Sir Diehärte.<$FFFE>
Sir Diehärte...<$FFFC>
I'm worried about your mental health...<$FFFD>
Please contact a doctor as soon as possible...<$FFFE>
<$F702><$F703>Leave it to me!<$FFFC>
There's nothing we can't handle with our skills combined skills!<$FFFE>
<$F702><$F703>Leave it to me!<$FFFC>
There's nothing we can't handle with our skills combined skills!<$FFFE>
Hey hey!<$FFFC>
I just thought about joining the fun, but it seems you already cleared the plate yourself, no?<$FFFE>
Yeah.<$FFFC>
I guess our strategy worked out pretty well.<$FFFE>
I see!<$FFFC>
Anyway I think I owe you one.<$FFFD>
It's settled!<$FFFC>
From now on I'll fight alongside you!<$FFFD>
Laffel is free once again.<$FFFE>
...The town of Laffel.<$FFFC>
I finally fulfilled my promise to Geriord.<$FFFC>
Well then, release the townspeople!<$FFFE>
Prepare yourself, Flaire!<$FFFE>
Mind yourself!<$FFFE>
For all those who lost their lives today, I will carry on!<$FFFE>
I won't give in to death just yet!<$FFFE>
Diehärte...<$FFFC>
It may looks grim for me,<$FFFD>
but I won't give in until my last breath!<$FFFE>
What do you say?<$FFFE>
Hold back<$FFFE>
I have no desire to fight<$FFFE>
Stop it<$FFFE>
Don't worry.<$FFFC>
I'll try to hold back somewhat.<$FFFE>
Don't you ever mock me like this!<$FFFD>
I won't stand that kind of attitude!<$FFFE>
Please stop!<$FFFC>
You know I don't want to fight you!<$FFFE>
Oh but I'm itching to cross swords with you to repay you for last time!<$FFFD>
Prepare yourself!<$FFFE>
Stop this pointless struggle!<$FFFC>
This battle is already decided!<$FFFE>
Is that so!<$FFFC>
My strategy wasn't flawless and many soldiers had to die.<$FFFD>
But don't you dare calling what they fought for a pointless thing!<$FFFE>
N..No!<$FFFE>
!<$FFFE>
Prin...cess..<$FFFE>
No way I go down like...this...<$FFFE>
T.That's...<$FFFE>
They got me!<$FFFE>
...I died on a foreign field...<$FFFE>
Laffel has fallen...<$FFFE>
Over my dead body you tread...<$FFFC>
Victory to our glorious kingdom!<$FFFE>
The Barral Kingdom will be victorious!<$FFFE>
Wind, carry my soul back to where my homeland is...<$FFFE>
Our corpses shall form an impenetrable wall...<$FFFE>
Remnants of Larcuss...<$FFFE>
Stop..their..advance!<$FFFC>
At all...cost..<$FFFE>
Just try it!<$FFFC>
You won't leave here alive!<$FFFE>
It's over so soon...<$FFFE>
!!<$FFFE>
Oh Wind, grant us victory!<$FFFE>
Your Majesty!<$FFFE>
I...can't move...<$FFFE>
How...<$FFFC>
...could such a ragtag division defeat us...<$FFFE>
Idiot me!<$FFFC>
You mustn't yield, no matter what comes through that gate!<$FFFE>
Now you did it!<$FFFE>
To be defeated like this...<$FFFE>
I can hear the wind...<$FFFE>
I was already dead inside...<$FFFE>
...<$FFFE>
M...mother...<$FFFE>
Uuuuhh...<$FFFE>
Such impudence!<$FFFE>
Not again...<$FFFE>
Urgh!<$FFFC>
What's that?<$FFFE>
Be...careful...<$FFFE>
Those guys are cowards!<$FFFD>
Fighting is horrible...<$FFFE>
W..What!<$FFFE>
Dammit, my body just won't move...<$FFFE>
Power of the wind...<$FFFE>
I give up!<$FFFE>
Oh, all this pointless killing...<$FFFC>
May Lushiris forgive you...<$FFFE>
Forgive me everyone.<$FFFC>
I was a poor leader to you...<$FFFD>
I wonder if things would have been different if the Dark Knight would have been here instead...<$FFFE>
...<$FFFD>
You have grown strong, Diehärte...and brutal no less...<$FFFE>
Diehärte!<$FFFC>
I will take my leave now.<$FFFC>
However, this is not the conclusion of our story!<$FFFE>
Silver Wolf joined the fun!<$FFFE>
Thanks, Wolf.<$FFFC>
You really know how to show up at the right moment.<$FFFE>
Thanks.<$FFFC>
Your assistance is highly appreciated.<$FFFE>
Yessir!<$FFFE>
Mobile units intercept the enemy!<$FFFE>
Understood!<$FFFE>
Encircle the enemy!<$FFFC>
Advance!<$FFFE>
All troops to the west have been defeated...<$FFFD>
I feared as much, Diehärte.<$FFFC>
Such flawless strategy...<$FFFD>
But this battle is still far from being decided!<$FFFE>
Princess!<$FFFC>
The eastern gate has fallen!<$FFFE>
If that is the case,<$FFFC>
abandon your post and incorporate with our main body!<$FFFE>
Understood!<$FFFE>
Take cover!<$FFFE>
Take cover!<$FFFE>
Relief troops are on their way!<$FFFE>
Relief troops are on their way!<$FFFE>
They have entered the town!<$FFFC>
Charge!<$FFFE>
They have entered the town!<$FFFC>
Charge!<$FFFE>
Show them what we're made of!<$FFFE>
Show them what we're made of!<$FFFE>
...That's taken care of, sure feels good to know them gone.<$FFFE>
Hey now!<$FFFC>
Of course I want to express my gratitude.<$FFFC>
After all you went through all that to liberated Laffel, that's no small feat.<$FFFD>
I have to repay you somehow!<$FFFD>
I know!<$FFFC>
From now on I'll personally fight alongside you!<$FFFC>
All that's left now is to recapture the capitol, Larcussia.<$FFFE>
