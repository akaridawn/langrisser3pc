Scenario - 16<$FFFC>
"Call to Arms"<$FFFE>
Bolstered by many new friends and the acquisition of the<$FFFC>
Haja no Ken, [diehardt's name]'s mobile division decides<$FFFC>
next to recapture the capitol of Laffel.<$FFFE>
However, since the Dark Knight is seldom absent from<$FFFC>
Laffel for any length of time, their margin for victory is<$FFFC>
slim.  However, the Dark Knight will likely leave Laffel<$FFFC>
to answer a call to arms.<$FFFE>
A key element in the party's plan to fake a call to arms is<$FFFC>
coordination with those left behind to keep tabs on Laffel.<$FFFC>
[diehardt's name] has asked to be given the chance to<$FFFC>
infiltrate Laffel alone.  Now the day the stratagem will be<$FFFC>
executed grows near.<$FFFE>
*Condition for Victory<$FFFC>
 -Complete annihilation of enemies<$FFFC>
*Condition for Defeat<$FFFC>
 -Death of [diehardt's name]<$FFFE>
Laffel - Currently Occupied by Barral<$FFFF>
.....He sure is late.<$FFFD>
Should I....., No, I'll hold out and wait a little longer.<$FFFE>
Even though this place has been occupied by Barral, there sure are plenty of things for sale.<$FFFD>
....Just goes to show Larcuss has always been a  bountiful country.<$FFFE>
Welcome.<$FFFC>
How are you today?  See anything that catches your eye?<$FFFD>
How about this charming brooch?<$FFFC>
It's been a very popular item lately, and this is the last one I have.<$FFFD>
It's quite a deal at the low price of 100P.<$FFFE>
This certainly is a beautiful piece of silverwork.<$FFFC>
At only 100P, there's no reason to hold off buying it right now.<$FFFE>
But, there's only one.....<$FFFE>
Who will you buy it for?<$FFFE>
For Tiaris<$FFFE>
For Riffany<$FFFE>
For Luna<$FFFE>
For Sophia<$FFFE>
Don't buy it<$FFFE>
It looks like it would suit Tiaris well.<$FFFB>
<$FFFC>
Very well, I'd like to buy it.<$FFFE>
Haha.<$FFFC>
Tiaris will likely be delighted....<$FFFE>
It looks like it would suit Riffany well.<$FFFB>
<$FFFC>
Very well, I'd like to buy it.<$FFFE>
Haha.<$FFFC>
Riffany will likely be delighted....<$FFFE>
It looks like it would suit Luna well.<$FFFB>
<$FFFC>
Very well, I'd like to buy it.<$FFFE>
Haha.<$FFFC>
Luna will likely be delighted....<$FFFE>
It looks like it would suit Sophia well.<$FFFB>
<$FFFC>
Very well, I'd like to buy it.<$FFFE>
Haha.<$FFFC>
Sophia will likely be delighted....<$FFFE>
No, sorry, I think I'll pass.<$FFFE>
I see....<$FFFB>
<$FFFC>
That's too bad.....<$FFFE>
Long time no see, [diehardt's name].<$FFFE>
You've been a hell of a busy boy, haven't you.<$FFFC>
I've heard all about it through the grape vine.<$FFFE>
Good to see you safe and as perky as ever, Wolf.<$FFFE>
Heheh!<$FFFC>
It's not a simple task to catch me, the clever Silver Wolf.<$FFFE>
Speaking of capture, do you know anything about a knight named Geriord?<$FFFE>
Geriord?<$FFFC>
Ah, the knight who was in the sick bed that time?<$FFFE>
Well, right after Laffel was occupied, he was escorted to Barral.<$FFFE>
After that, I don't know much - maybe he never recovered from that wound.<$FFFE>
I see......<$FFFE>
Did you have any other reason to come here?<$FFFE>
Yes, we're going to start a campaign to recapture Laffel, beginning with an invasion of Barral proper.<$FFFE>
Hey now, are you crazy!?<$FFFE>
It's always been a small country, but that doesn't mean you can conquer it with your small force!<$FFFE>
True, but we're doing it to get the Dark Knight to move from his watchpost here.<$FFFE>
If the Dark Knight weren't here, we'd be able to return and quickly recapture Laffel.<$FFFE>
But, to make this work I'll need your help.<$FFFE>
Alrighty, keep talking.<$FFFC>
Can you keep tabs on the Dark Knight's movements?<$FFFC>
Leave it to me!<$FFFE>
If that's it, I'll head out now.<$FFFC>
Wouldn't be a pretty picture to get found by those Barral flunkies.<$FFFE>
!!<$FFFE>
P..princess Flaire.....<$FFFE>
!?<$FFFC>
Sheesh!<$FFFC>
Over here.<$FFFE>
You, what are you doing here!<$FFFC>
For now this place is under Barral's control...., and it looks like we're on opposite sides, right!?<$FFFE>
....Flaire.<$FFFC>
I've got something I'd like to ask you.<$FFFC>
Why did Barral invade this country?<$FFFE>
We were allied together, and I never would have thought King Wilder would turn that against us.<$FFFE>
....For me, for me it is so heart-rending to see Father as he is right now!<$FFFE>
But, I am the princess of Barral!<$FFFC>
I am Father's daughter!<$FFFE>
If I abandoned him, Father's only ally would be that unfathomable black knight!<$FFFE>
........<$FFFE>
Now, why did you choose to return to Laffel?<$FFFE>
What do you say in response?<$FFFE>
To meet with you.<$FFFE>
To fight the Dark Knight.<$FFFE>
Out of concern for a friend.<$FFFE>
Why, I wanted to meet you, of course.<$FFFE>
.........<$FFFB>
<$FFFC>
..Liar.....<$FFFE>
.........<$FFFE>
But,<$FFFB>
<$FFFC>
Even if it's a lie, it makes me happy.<$FFFE>
How did we ever come to such straits in our relationship.....<$FFFE>
Flaire.....<$FFFE>
I really couldn't say.<$FFFD>
To defeat the Dark Knight.<$FFFE>
The Dark Knight?<$FFFE>
That's right.<$FFFD>
I'm certain he's behind what's happened to King Wilder......<$FFFE>
I hate to say it, but that's not quite right.<$FFFD>
Father had changed quite a while before he appeared.<$FFFD>
Furthermore, this Dark Knight has some bizarre strength.<$FFFC>
Stop contemplating such folly.<$FFFE>
.....Agh........<$FFFE>
The time I fled the flying citadel, during the Empire's invasion, I was forced to leave behind a wounded knight, named Geriord.<$FFFE>
Right after we left, it looks like Barral took over Laffel.<$FFFE>
Do you know anything about him?<$FFFE>
So you came back here because you were worried about this man?<$FFFE>
.....Hmm.<$FFFC>
I wasn't a part of the conquest of this place, and I'm afraid I don't know of any prisoners.<$FFFE>
Is that so......<$FFFE>
Ah!<$FFFE>
You have to get out of here immediately.<$FFFC>
The guards are coming!<$FFFE>
So, get a move on!<$FFFE>
F..Flaire....<$FFFE>
Hurry!<$FFFE>
.......<$FFFE>
A present for a girlfriend, is it?<$FFFB>
<$FFFC>
Here you are; please come again.<$FFFE>
<$FFFC>
Bought a souvenir.<$FFFE>
<$FFFF>
