Mountains Near the Central Gate<$FFFF>
Awww, aren't we there yet?<$FFFC>
I'm getting tired!<$FFFE>
This is the last mountain we have to cross; we should be there shortly.<$FFFE>
We have to reactivate Lushiris gate as soon as possible to prevent the demons from invading. We would stand no chance against them, the Empire and Barral all at once.<$FFFE>
Hang in there, everyone.<$FFFE>
!?<$FFFC>
Sir [diehardt's name], there's something ahead!<$FFFE>
It is not human, an evil aura can be felt around here.<$FFFC>
Everyone, please be careful.<$FFFE>
Kyaaa!<$FFFC>
S..Someone!?<$FFFE>
GUURRR!<$FFFE>
The unmistakeable scream of a terrified girl!<$FFFC>
That other voice was that of some kind of monster no doubt!<$FFFE>
There are monsters around!?<$FFFE>
Hurry, we have to save her!<$FFFE>
Sir [diehardt's name].<$FFFC>
There is a lot of forest on these mountains, it would be an excellent place for an ambush.<$FFFC>
Please stay alert.<$FFFE>
Of course.<$FFFC>
The enemy probably is lurking in the shadows, just waiting for us to get careless.<$FFFE>
We are dealing with monsters, which are much more skilled in hiding than humans to begin with.<$FFFE>
Alright, everyone!<$FFFC>
Expect the unexpected and stay alert at all times.<$FFFE>
We all heard your conversation, but okay!<$FFFE>
Thanks to your carelessness I've got you exactly where I wanted you.<$FFFD>
Play time is over!<$FFFD>
All troops move out!<$FFFC>
Crush the enemy and don't you fail me!<$FFFE>
GAAAA!<$FFFE>
Thanks to your carelessness I've got you exactly where I wanted you.<$FFFD>
Play time is over!<$FFFE>
Uh!<$FFFC>
Not half bad for a human, I've got to say.<$FFFD>
Come back in another 10 years and you may even stand a chance!<$FFFE>
Dammit!<$FFFC>
Still more are coming, is there no end to them!?<$FFFE>
Ahahaha!<$FFFD>
What laughable creatures they are.<$FFFC>
Chase them around all over the place!<$FFFE>
Well then, you should be the perfect warm-up exercise before I take on that sorceress.<$FFFC>
Fight hard my darlings!<$FFFE>
Yes ma'am!<$FFFE>
GAAAA!<$FFFE>
There got to be a way to drive them back...<$FFFE>
If we can bring down their commander, the other demons most likely would back down as well.<$FFFE>
It has to be that woman, Ferakia...<$FFFE>
Ah..,Ah...<$FFFE>
Are you alright?<$FFFC>
We are here to help you.<$FFFE>
Now that we're here you don't have to be scared anymore.<$FFFE>
*Giggle*...,..idiotic humans...<$FFFE>
?<$FFFC>
What are you saying?<$FFFE>
Honestly, you're way too gullible aren't you?<$FFFC>
Letting yourselves being deceived like that!<$FFFE>
!?<$FFFC>
A transformation!?<$FFFE>
Did you enjoy the little show that I, Ferakia the Shapeshiftress has put up for you?<$FFFE>
Well then my darlings, come out wherever you are!<$FFFE>
This was planed from the beginning.<$FFFC>
I'm at a loss for words...<$FFFE>
How do you react?<$FFFE>
Don't worry<$FFFE>
To err is human<$FFFE>
Say nothing.<$FFFE>
There's no need to be abashed.<$FFFC>
After all you warned us of the ambush, did you not?<$FFFE>
Sir [diehardt's name]...<$FFFC>
Thank you for your goodwill.<$FFFE>
Anyway, let's just get rid of those demons already!<$FFFE>
Yes sir!<$FFFE>
The enemy's strategy wasn't transparent.<$FFFC>
Making mistakes is part of being human.<$FFFC>
...Don't worry about it.<$FFFE>
That's still no excuse for failing so...<$FFFE>
...<$FFFE>
-Defeat Ferakia<$FFFE>
-Death of [diehardt's name]<$FFFE>
You come across an enormous ancient stone statue, which lies in ruins before you.<$FFFC>
When you inspect it closely you discover some ancient writings.<$FFFD>
"I'm longing for a black eyed sacrifice.<$FFFC>
If you wish to donate, use the metal bowl!"<$FFFE>
What will be the sacrifice of your choice?<$FFFE>
Tiaris<$FFFE>
Nothing<$FFFE>
1000P<$FFFE>
Are you out of your mind!?<$FFFE>
Suddenly a voice can be heard, emanating from the stone statue.<$FFFD>
"The spirits accept your offering."<$FFFC>
Take this as a token of our appreciation."<$FFFE>
Artemis Bow was obtained!<$FFFE>
Tiaris..is...<$FFFE>
With a bang your money vanished.<$FFFE>
Artemis Bow was obtained!<$FFFE>
Please no....<$FFFC>
I guess it's..over..<$FFFE>
Ouchy!<$FFFC>
It hurts...where's my mummy...or Sophia?<$FFFE>
Curses!<$FFFE>
My sword arm grows hair...<$FFFE>
Guaaa!<$FFFE>
Oh?<$FFFC>
Why does death feel so pleasant...?<$FFFE>
I'm sorry...<$FFFE>
Thank you...for...nothing<$FFFE>
To act so violently against a woman!<$FFFC>
Such unseemly behavior!<$FFFE>
I'm afraid that's enough fun for today...<$FFFE>
Sir [diehardt's name], only thanks to your splendid commanding did we emerge victorious.<$FFFE>
Sir [diehardt's name]....<$FFFC>
You're slow both in mind and commanding...<$FFFD>
This shame will carry on to the next mission...<$FFFE>
Velzeria becomes more active by the minute those are signs that the upcoming invasion is drawing near.<$FFFE>
Velzeria becomes more active by the minute those are signs that the upcoming invasion is drawing near.<$FFFE>
We cannot waste another minute.<$FFFC>
We're moving on this instant!<$FFFE>
So much flesh and so little time to carve it, now where should I begin?<$FFFE>
Wonderful.<$FFFC>
All that crimson blood makes me so hot!<$FFFD>
Come now, let our bodies disgorge rivers of the sweetest of wines!<$FFFE>
Uuu...<$FFFE>
Damn.<$FFFC>
We didn't make it in time...<$FFFE>
Now, aren't you a useless bunch?<$FFFC>
Honestly nowadays so called heroes can't even help one measly little girl in trouble.<$FFFE>
!?<$FFFC>
She transformed!?<$FFFE>
Oh, so you liked my little show?<$FFFC>
Unfortunately it will be the last thing you'll ever see!<$FFFD>
Well then, come out to play, everyone!<$FFFE>
-Defeat Ferakia<$FFFE>
-Death of Dieh채rte [diehardt's name]<$FFFE>
Kyaaa!<$FFFC>
Someone, help me!<$FFFE>
Please, someone...<$FFFE>
Hold out!<$FFFC>
Help is on the way!<$FFFE>
Come fast, I beg of you!<$FFFE>
GOOOO!<$FFFE>

Take me in soothing death!<$FFFE>
GUHAAA!<$FFFE>

Oh aren't they just too adorable...?<$FFFC>
Well my darlings now you can slaughter all you want and afterwards we'll have a good nap!<$FFFE>
Blasted! So there where troops in hiding and so many at that!<$FFFE>
Hehehe...<$FFFC>
Kill them all...<$FFFE>
Give it to them slowly and painfully; Uhh I'm getting all fired up just thinking about the fun.<$FFFE>
I shall do as you say.<$FFFE>
La..dy...Fer..akia..<$FFFC>
Excu..se..us..for..be..ing..late...<$FFFE>
Don't just linger around there you slow-pokes!<$FFFC>
Deliver certain death to them this instance!<$FFFE>
We're fighting and fighting and still the number of enemies grows.<$FFFE>
Nonetheless we have to persevere!<$FFFE>
GRUUU...devour!<$FFFE>
More enemies!?<$FFFE>
More enemies!?<$FFFE>
Ahahaha!<$FFFC>
Oh, what's wrong?<$FFFC>
You know, I'm always here for you to chew your ear off, figuratively!<$FFFE>
Is it the demon's strategy to overwhelm the enemy with sheer numbers?<$FFFE>
