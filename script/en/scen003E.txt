Listen up!<$FFFC>
Only pretend to be rough with those nonresisting grubbers!<$FFFE>
Just capture them, unless it's unprofitable to do so!<$FFFE>
As you wish!<$FFFE>
Hmmm!?<$FFFE>
What's wrong, [diehardt's name]?<$FFFE>
They're....not from the Imperial army.<$FFFE>
Huh?<$FFFC>
If that's so, then who on earth...<$FFFE>
Impossible!<$FFFC>
That's the army of the Barral Kingdom!<$FFFE>
Barral Kingdom!?<$FFFC>
Aren't they our allies!?<$FFFE>
What could have possibly happened?<$FFFE>
...Anyhow, the citizens are having a hard time escaping...we've got to help them, with or without backup!<$FFFE>
Kyaa!<$FFFE>
Round up the citizens!<$FFFE>
But then that party will get away...<$FFFE>
But then that party will get away...<$FFFE>
It can't be helped!<$FFFC>
We can only take this pretense of cruelty so far!<$FFFC>
Damn!<$FFFE>
It's dangerous over there!<$FFFC>
Flee to the south gate!<$FFFE>
O..okay!<$FFFE>
Don't let them escape!<$FFFC>
Kill all of these obstructions!<$FFFE>
King Wilder!<$FFFC>
Have you forgotten who I am!?<$FFFC>
I'm the son of Klaus!<$FFFE>
Klaus?<$FFFC>
...Ah, that's right. You're Klaus's little boy.<$FFFE>
[diehardt's name], you know that person?<$FFFE>
[diehardt's name], you know that person?<$FFFE>
Yes.<$FFFD>
Barral Kingdom and the house of Klaus have always had a close relationship.<$FFFD>
...but, why would the kind-hearted King Wilder....<$FFFE>
Your friend in the past is your enemy today, huh.<$FFFC>
Well, they say that people change.<$FFFE>
Enough of this senseless jabbering.<$FFFC>
Die and be silenced! Slay them! Don't let a single one escape!<$FFFE>
Miss Layla!<$FFFC>
Please flee through the south gate!<$FFFC>
Hurry!<$FFFE>
...Geriord.<$FFFE>
Miss Layla!<$FFFE>
Y-Yes?<$FFFE>
Hurry to the south gate!<$FFFE>
Alright...<$FFFE>
Who the hell are you, bastard?<$FFFE>
W..who's that!<$FFFE>
If you don't recognize me, you're a full-blown Barral bumpkin!<$FFFE>
Alright, listen up:<$FFFC>
I am the heavenly-descended, grand and honorable thief, Sir Silver Wolf!<$FFFE>
This is our town!<$FFFC>
Your foul work ends here!<$FFFE>
What can a self-styled thief possibly do?<$FFFE>
If he does try anything, he'll find it a painful experience...<$FFFE>
Hmph!<$FFFC>
I'll make you eat those words!<$FFFE>
Silver Wolf?<$FFFC>
That renowned honorable thief....<$FFFE>
Die!<$FFFC>
Let none escape!<$FFFE>
Who are you?<$FFFC>
He doesn't look like a knight.<$FFFE>
Who the hell are you, bastard?<$FFFC>
Nimwit, you've only come here to die.<$FFFE>
Hmmph!<$FFFC>
Do you really think you can kill me, the grand and honorable thief, Sir Silver Wolf?<$FFFC>
Such utter unwordliness proves you're nothing but a country-confined Barral bumkin!<$FFFE>
I'll make you eat those words!<$FFFE>
General!<$FFFC>
There's a Larcussian knight over there!<$FFFC>
With his help, it looks like the citizens will be able to escape!<$FFFE>
What did you say!?<$FFFE>
He's a young one!<$FFFC>
Once he gets his first taste of cold steel, he'll change his tune!<$FFFE>
Hey, lass, we'll take it from here - hurry up and escape!<$FFFE>
I'll do no such thing!<$FFFC>
If I did, you might get captured, Mr. Wolf!<$FFFE>
....'kay.<$FFFC>
Thanks, Mr. Wolf.<$FFFE>
Hey, Mr. Knight, we'll take it from here - hurry up and escape!<$FFFE>
Just be careful, Wolf<$FFFC>
Even you can be caught!<$FFFE>
Thanks, Wolf.<$FFFE>
Just a little farther!<$FFFC>
Everyone, hang in there!<$FFFE>
Will do!(That is right!)<$FFFC>
Right now, I can just run right through them!<$FFFE>
Farewell, Laffel...<$FFFE>
Wow.<$FFFC>
We've made it!<$FFFE>
Thank you, Sir Knight<$FFFC>
We've made it.<$FFFE>
Well, let's hurry on out.<$FFFE>
Alright, we can escape unhindered from here.<$FFFE>
Geriord....<$FFFE>
Miss Layla!<$FFFC>
We will come back here in a little bit.<$FFFC>
Please be patient a little longer.<$FFFE>
Okay.<$FFFE>
A magic herb grows in a dark corner under the stairwell.<$FFFE>
Magic Herb was obtained!<$FFFE>
In the center of the vacant area, a strange looking fruit lied abandoned.<$FFFE>
Do you want to pick it up?<$FFFE>
Ambrosia was obtained!<$FFFE>
While you pause to think, a strong wind surges and blows the strange fruit away....<$FFFE>
Sheesh.....<$FFFC>
Why can't I protect<$FFFC>
even myself from harm......<$FFFE>
Damn!<$FFFC>
Why is Barral attacking!?<$FFFE>
This is bad.<$FFFC>
At this rate we'll be completely surrounded.<$FFFC>
If we don't escape quickly...<$FFFE>
Oooouccch!!<$FFFC>
It hurts!!!!  ....ouch....<$FFFE>
Don't push too hard, Tiaris.<$FFFC>
Retreat for now!<$FFFE>
O..ok.<$FFFC>
Forgive me, [diehardt's name].<$FFFE>
Don't interfere!<$FFFE>
Shit!<$FFFC>
I can't do any more!<$FFFE>
I'm so sorry, Wolf!<$FFFC>
We'll manage the rest somehow without you.<$FFFD>
Hurry and escape before you're captured!<$FFFE>
Huh...alright.<$FFFC>
But, be sure to escape yourselves!<$FFFE>
<$F702><$F703>Sorry, Boss.<$FFFC>
Somehow, they got us.....<$FFFE>
Damn you, Barral bastards!<$FFFE>
Ugh, damn!<$FFFC>
To die in a place like this....<$FFFE>
My...dear.......<$FFFE>
Miss Layla!<$FFFD>
Geriord....<$FFFC>
Forgive me....I couldn't<$FFFC>
protect her.....<$FFFD>
I never have enough power......<$FFFE>
Agh, I mustn't!<$FFFE>
Ugh.....<$FFFE>
Miss Layla!<$FFFE>
Hurry, Tiaris.<$FFFC>
Miss Layla's in trouble!<$FFFE>
Shit!<$FFFC>
If we don't hurry...!<$FFFE>
Nooooo!<$FFFE>
I don't want to die....<$FFFC>
I don't want to....<$FFFE>
H...help.....<$FFFE>
Impossible...<$FFFC>
I never have enough power......<$FFFE>
I..impossible.....<$FFFC>
To have lost to such a young brat.....<$FFFE>
Sir DiosÅI<$FFFC>
Please, leave the rest to us and retreat!<$FFFE>
.....thanks.....<$FFFD>
I'm counting on you!<$FFFE>
We won't let you down!<$FFFE>
General DiosÅI<$FFFC>
Please, leave the rest to us and retreat!<$FFFE>
.....thanks.....<$FFFD>
I'm counting on you!<$FFFE>
Yes, sir!<$FFFE>
I feel bad about this,<$FFFC>
but it is war, after all.<$FFFE>
If you abandoned this futile resistance, you wouldn't have to die!<$FFFE>
No matter what kind of thief you are, you won't be smiling if you come against our main army!<$FFFE>
....Ugh!<$FFFC>
W..what.....no, not yet!<$FFFE>
Ruud!<$FFFC>
Retreat, you can't continue like this!<$FFFE>
But, Sir Dios...<$FFFE>
Ruud!<$FFFC>
Fool, didn't you hear my order?!<$FFFE>
M..my humble apologies....<$FFFE>
Guhaa!<$FFFD>
At this rate, I won't be able to fight any further....<$FFFC>
I can't take any more - I'm retreating!<$FFFE>
I won't continue if I have to go against women and pacifists....<$FFFE>
Ugh....<$FFFE>
W..what!<$FFFE>
Damn....<$FFFE>
Don't even think of running away!<$FFFE>
I....<$FFFC>
To expire in this kind of place....<$FFFE>
Ugh, I can do no more!<$FFFE>
Guhaa!<$FFFE>
One more try....<$FFFC>
Until I've touched the soil of my homeland....<$FFFC>
I can't afford....to....die.....<$FFFE>
Ugh.....<$FFFC>
S..such shame....<$FFFE>
Ugh....<$FFFC>
You can't have finished me....<$FFFC>
I can't die in this kind of place....<$FFFE>
I..I.....<$FFFC>
Is this the end?.....<$FFFE>
................<$FFFE>
Miserable wretch....how did you manage to defeat the likes of me...<$FFFC>
Bah, don't think this is the end, though -<$FFFD>
I swear to conquer Laffel.<$FFFC>
Next time I'll bring a larger army!<$FFFE>
I've failed!<$FFFE>
T..they got me....<$FFFE>
Y...you damned Larcussians!<$FFFE>
Aaa......<$FFFC>
I can't go any farther....<$FFFE>
But, I made it this far....<$FFFE>
Dios's army has been completely annihilated!<$FFFC>
That damned incompetent clearly couldn't handle this level of responsibility!<$FFFD>
Everyone, listen up!<$FFFC>
Let not a single Larcussian escape!<$FFFC>
Kill them, kill them all!<$FFFE>
....But, won't that include the citizens in the body count?<$FFFE>
Did you not hear what my orders were!?<$FFFE>
Sir!<$FFFC>
My humble apologies!<$FFFE>
Sir!<$FFFE>
I shall do as you say!<$FFFE>
Hmm.....<$FFFC>
It looks like all units have been destroyed.<$FFFE>
Indeed.<$FFFC>
They must have not expected resistance.<$FFFD>
But, before long King Wilder will bring reinforcements against us.<$FFFC>
Let's hurry and escape from here.<$FFFE>
Okay.<$FFFE>
Somehow, it seems all are foes have been destroyed.<$FFFD>
But, before long King Wilder will bring reinforcements against us.<$FFFC>
Let's hurry and escape from here.<$FFFE>
Hey there, Mr. Knight!<$FFFC>
Lend me a hand, here.<$FFFC>
Now that I'm here, just focus on escorting the citizens out of here!<$FFFE>
Thanks, Silver Wolf.<$FFFE>
Do me a favor and just call me Wolf!<$FFFE>
Alright, you rascals!<$FFFC>
 Let's go and teach that country bumpkin of a general how we differ from the average thief!<$FFFE>
Do me a favor and just call me Wolf!<$FFFE>
Alright, you rascals!<$FFFC>
 Let's go and teach that country bumpkin of a general how we differ from the average thief!<$FFFE>
Do me a favor and just call me Wolf!<$FFFE>
Alright, you rascals! Let's go and teach that country bumpkin of a general how we differ from the average thief!<$FFFE>
Will do, Boss!<$FFFE>
Alright, you rascals!<$FFFC>
Get ready!<$FFFE>
Hey, now.<$FFFC>
Who do you think I am?<$FFFD>
Even if I get surrounded, there's no way I'd be caught by those Barral soldier-goons!<$FFFC>
Stop worrying.<$FFFE>
Looks like Dios's troops are having a hard time.<$FFFE>
Dios, what are you doing fooling around like this!<$FFFE>
My humble apologies, King Wilder!<$FFFC>
When we were advancing, we managed to get separated from the citizens....<$FFFE>
Dios, you damned fool!<$FFFC>
I never should have trusted you with this level of responsibility!<$FFFE>
My humble apologies, King Wilder!<$FFFC>
When we were advancing, we managed to get separated from the citizens....<$FFFE>
My humble apologies, King Wilder!<$FFFC>
When we were advancing, we managed to get separated from the citizens....<$FFFE>
Don't worry about the lives of the citizens!<$FFFC>
Kill everyone who gets in your way!<$FFFE>
After we take Laffel from Larcuss Kingdom, we'll target the wealthy royal capital, Larcussia.<$FFFE>
Use whatever means are necessary!<$FFFC>
With this opportunity, we can invade straight to the heart of Larcuss.<$FFFE>
*chokes* ... Understood....<$FFFE>
General, are we really going to attack the citizens?<$FFFE>
It's our King's command.<$FFFC>
Even if it means slaying the citizens, we must fulfill our duty.<$FFFE>
But...<$FFFE>
I know what you're saying.<$FFFC>
I don't want to do it either!<$FFFE>
..........<$FFFE>
T..that's King Wilder!?<$FFFE>
Hold it right there!<$FFFC>
No longer shall you have your way in our city!<$FFFE>
Thanks, Wolf.<$FFFE>
Unequivocably, I swear to return!<$FFFE>
Please keep alive til then.<$FFFE>
Ugh! So they've managed to escape...<$FFFE>
Wretch, now only one foe remains!<$FFFC>
Those damned lucky bastards!<$FFFE>
Hmm, looks like if I do it just right, I can still escape.<$FFFE>
Thanks, Wolf.<$FFFE>
Glad to have been of assistance!<$FFFE>
Geriord...<$FFFE>
Miss Layla,<$FFFC>
I swear I'll return and save him.<$FFFE>
....I'm sorry, [diehardt's name].<$FFFC>
I've been such a burden, letting my emotions get the best of me.<$FFFD>
But, I'm calm now.<$FFFC>
Let's hurry out of here.<$FFFE>
.....<$FFFE>
Oh, by the way.<$FFFC>
When the citizens fled the city, they handed me this to give to you in thanks,<$FFFD>
saying "Please deliver this to the brave Sir Knight."<$FFFE>
Received the Angel Ring!<$FFFE>
Thanks.<$FFFC>
I'll be sure to put it to good use.<$FFFE>
...Hey, [diehardt's name].<$FFFC>
What are we going to do now?<$FFFE>
Good question. I think we should seek out my uncle...Viscount Raymond.<$FFFD>
His domain is removed from Larcuss Kingdom, since it is enclosed by mountains, so the Empire probably hasn't reached it yet.<$FFFE>
And we'll muster an army there?<$FFFE>
Indeed.<$FFFC>
And then, we'll retaliate.<$FFFC>
So, let's go.<$FFFE>
Well, I'll be pulling out soon...<$FFFE>
<$F702><$F703>Of course I will!<$FFFC>
It will be a piece of cake for me to put off dying til then.<$FFFE>
Later, Mr. Knight.<$FFFC>
If we both stay alive, we'll meet again!<$FFFE>
