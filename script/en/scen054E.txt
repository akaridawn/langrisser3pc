Scenario - 07<$FFFC>
"Mountain Pass Reunion"<$FFFE>
The strategy succeeded in opening hostilities between the<$FFFC>
armies of the RigÅEer Empire and Barral Kingdom.<$FFFC>
Continued hostilities could buy the party enough time.<$FFFE>
[diehardt's name] and company had begun to move to Lushiris Gate,<$FFFC>
their first destination, passing through the Railym Mountains.<$FFFE>
But there, a precious but sorrowful reunion was awaiting [diehardt's name].<$FFFE>
*Condition for Victory<$FFFC>
 -Defeat of Flaire<$FFFC>
*Condition for Defeat<$FFFC>
 -Death of [diehardt's name]<$FFFE>
Highway Leading to the Center of the Lushiris Gate<$FFFF>
A messenger from Lord Raymond has arrived.<$FFFE>
I see, send him in.<$FFFE>
Miss Layla!?<$FFFE>
Miss Layla, why are you here?<$FFFE>
Is my being the wife of a knight not enough of a reason?<$FFFE>
I get so irritated that I can do nothing, while Geriord remains in Laffel....<$FFFE>
Miss Layla......Geriord...<$FFFE>
At least this way I can be of some service to everyone.<$FFFE>
My heart won't rest until Geriord has returned!<$FFFE>
.......<$FFFE>
Anyhow, Lord Raymond has asked that you all work to liberate two of the four gates, those to the south and to the east.<$FFFD>
Do you have any questions?.....<$FFFE>
What are they?<$FFFB>
<$FFFC>
I mean, these so-called four gates?<$FFFE>
My, you don't know about them, Pierre-san?<$FFFD>
The four gates are holy gates which power the Lushiris Gate and convey the divine protection of Lady Lushiris to the kingdom of Larcuss.<$FFFE>
You mean that in order to renew the Lushiris Gate, we need to liberate these four gates?<$FFFE>
Exactly.<$FFFD>
If we don't, then it looks like we will be attacked by the demons from Velzeria.<$FFFE>
And, we certainly have no desire to face yet another opponent.<$FFFD>
We must do all we can to ward our land against evil and halt the invasions of our blessed land.<$FFFE>
Indeed.<$FFFE>
Well then, for now let's go and liberate the southern gate.<$FFFE>
Inform all our troops!<$FFFB>
<$FFFC>
Then, let's get moving!<$FFFE>
Everyone, please do your best.<$FFFE>
