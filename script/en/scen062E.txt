Scenario - 11<$FFFC>
"Spectral Lady"<$FFFE>
Sophia, rescued from being sacrificed by the Shika Tribe, has<$FFFC>
now joined the party as they head towards the eastern gate.<$FFFE>
However, in the forest ahead, there is a suspicious-looking<$FFFC>
shadow which always follows them yet shies away from<$FFFC>
human contact.<$FFFE>
*Condition for Victory<$FFFC>
 -Rescue of NPC<$FFFC>
*Conditions for Defeat<$FFFC>
 -Death of [diehardt's name]<$FFFC>
 -Death of NPC<$FFFE>
Gaiel and the Skyboat Fleet vs. the Dark Knight<$FFFF>
Hmmph.<$FFFC>
Now that fiend has come, will our dominance of the battlefield shift....<$FFFD>
Is this Dark Knight as strong as the rumors say.....<$FFFE>
I've received a report, sir!<$FFFD>
Several Barral aerial units have taken to flight!<$FFFE>
A full warship?<$FFFE>
No, sir!<$FFFC>
2 or 3 smaller units!<$FFFE>
Strengthen our anti-aircraft fire.<$FFFC>
Sink them like we did the others.<$FFFD>
Let's see how many times they try before they realize the futility of such attacks.<$FFFE>
Signal flares.....<$FFFB>
<$FFFC>
....Hmmm.....<$FFFD>
Wh..what...!?<$FFFC>
"Oil.....been defeated".......<$FFFC>
What could they mean......<$FFFE>
Oh, no!<$FFFC>
Hurry out of range!<$FFFE>
Just a little longer.....<$FFFC>
Soon they won't be able to escape.<$FFFB>
<$FFFC>
Now!<$FFFC>
Shoot the fire arrows!<$FFFE>
Archers!<$FFFC>
Attack all at once, to keep the element of surprise!<$FFFB>
<$FFFC>
Fiiiiiirrreeeeeeeee!!<$FFFE>
Sir!<$FFFC>
3 ships have been lit on fire!<$FFFC>
Is oil how they burned them so quickly!?<$FFFD>
W..what should we do!?<$FFFE>
Have the 2 ships on the left<$FFFC>
block the enemy aerial units.<$FFFD>
If we get their allies in the line of fire, they won't be able to attack as strongly.<$FFFE>
A message!<$FFFD>
Move two ships to the left!<$FFFC>
Engage in evasive action and bring us behind the enemy aerial units!<$FFFE>
Yes, sir!<$FFFE>
....Hmmph.<$FFFC>
....Hohoho!<$FFFD>
Damn you, Dark Knight, you and your taunting mockeries....<$FFFC>
Then again, if you didn't offer such insolence, things wouldn't be any fun!<$FFFE>
Mountains Near the Central Gate<$FFFF>
Everyone, there's no need to run away now.<$FFFC>
The power of that bitch Lushiris has disappeared.<$FFFE>
Gohhhhhh!<$FFFE>
We're striking against the Lushiris Gate to ensure the victory of Velzeria.<$FFFE>
That's why we're going to kill that sorceress said to guard the central Gate, Jessica.<$FFFE>
Then Master Bˆser's dream, a world ruled by monsters, can be realized.<$FFFC>
Kyahahahaha!<$FFFE>
!?<$FFFD>
Worrr......!!<$FFFE>
What, humans, you say!?<$FFFE>
....Hmmph!<$FFFC>
How could we lose to such feeble creatures.<$FFFE>
What a perfect opportunity for some exercise!<$FFFC>
So, everyone, fight to your heart's content!<$FFFE>
Gohhhhhh!<$FFFE>
<$FFFF>
