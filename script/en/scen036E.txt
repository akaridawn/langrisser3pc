Hurry!<$FFFC>
To the inner part!<$FFFE>
So this is the country of the Demon Tribe, Velzeria...<$FFFE>
We're here again, this place is getting on my nerves.<$FFFE>
This time we'd better finish it once and for all.<$FFFE>
I wonder if Tiaris is alright.<$FFFE>
I wonder if Riffany is alright.<$FFFE>
I wonder if Luna is alright.<$FFFE>
Unless we hurry Sophia will be in great danger!<$FFFE>
Quit babbling, if we don't hurry Flaire will be in real danger!<$FFFE>
...It appears that she is save, still.<$FFFE>
If she had been sacrificed and the ceremony to summon Chaos would have been completed, I would have noticed an immense surge of dark energy.<$FFFE>
How can you be sure, Varna?<$FFFE>
When Altemüller was Böser he used the dark power of Al Hazard to resurrect her.<$FFFB>
<$FFFE>
One could say she has a strong connection to darkness.<$FFFC>
That way what she says is most likely the truth.<$FFFE>
Anyhow any minute that we do nothing could be her last.<$FFFC>
Let's make great haste!<$FFFE>
Not so fast!<$FFFE>
Oh, it's Geier!<$FFFE>
I can not allow you to disturb master Böser.<$FFFE>
Soon lord Chaos will rise and we shall rule over all.<$FFFE>
But before that, I will dispose of you all right here right now!<$FFFC>
Especially you Altemüller!<$FFFC>
You'll get my special treatment!<$FFFE>
This is taking far too long already!<$FFFC>
Commence the attack!<$FFFE>
If we concentrate our attacks on Geier we should be able to win with relative ease.<$FFFE>
You said it!<$FFFC>
Let's do this!<$FFFE>
You think you can kill me that easily, how conceited of you.<$FFFD>
Let me demonstrate some of the powers lord Chaos has bestowed upon me!<$FFFE>
Well then, let us end this fast!<$FFFC>
We have come to far to back down now!<$FFFE>
Geier...!<$FFFE>
Chaos's revival draws closer with every elapsing minute...<$FFFD>
Hahaha!<$FFFC>
You might as well give up hope already!<$FFFE>
Just a little further everyone.<$FFFC>
Once we finish Geier, only Paul remains!<$FFFD>
Let us fight for our comrade and for the future of this world!<$FFFE>
Just you wait Geier!<$FFFC>
This time my blade will put an end to you for good!<$FFFE>
With the powers granted by lord Chaos, I no longer have anything to fear from your meager swordplay.<$FFFE>
GYAAAA!<$FFFE>
SYAAA!<$FFFE>
Yessir!<$FFFE>
GA!<$FFFE>
You are but small fry compared to our lord!<$FFFD>
The revival of lord Chaos is nigh!<$FFFC>
Soon this world will be enveloped in perfect darkness!<$FFFE>
Hehehe...<$FFFC>
So you made it this far.<$FFFD>
From here on every step you take will be a countdown for death!<$FFFE>
Oh yes,...<$FFFC>
Yours!<$FFFE>
We'll see about that!<$FFFC>
Come at me with all you got!<$FFFE>
How troublesome!<$FFFC>
Die already!<$FFFE>
There is a crack in the floor, beneath it bear earth can be seen.<$FFFD>
A long an narrow pole is sticking out from it.<$FFFE>
What do you do?<$FFFE>
Pull it out<$FFFE>
Break it<$FFFE>
Try using water to soften up the earth<$FFFE>
While trying to pull it out is got stuck.<$FFFE>
What do you do?<$FFFE>
Pull with all your strength<$FFFE>
Push it back into the earth<$FFFE>
Pull gently<$FFFE>
The stick broke with a sluggish sound.<$FFFE>
You decide to give up on pulling and instead push the stick and<$FFFD>
the stick disappears into the earth...<$FFFE>
As you pull the stick gently, it comes out with ease.<$FFFD>
Before you wonder as to what happened the stick changed into a spear.<$FFFE>
Gungnir was obtained!<$FFFE>
The stick broke with a sluggish sound.<$FFFE>
When the water was the soil becomes slushy.<$FFFD>
Thereupon the stick sinks down into the mud and disappears...<$FFFE>
Return Tiaris this instant!<$FFFE>
Return Riffany this instant!<$FFFE>
Return Luna this instant!<$FFFE>
Return Sophia this instant!<$FFFE>
Return Flaire this instant!<$FFFE>
Hehehe!<$FFFC>
I'm afraid about now she is being sacrificed to our great lord Chaos, but don't worry you'll be seeing her shortly!<$FFFE>
Bastard!<$FFFE>
G..Geier...<$FFFC>
Return..her...<$FFFE>
You are too late!<$FFFC>
Now lord Chaos will come to this world and our supreme rule will be established!<$FFFE>
I'm sorry, [diehardt's name].<$FFFC>
Tia, hang in there...<$FFFE>
I'm sorry,[diehardt's name].<$FFFC>
How faint-hearted...<$FFFE>
It is painful to have the one you love most being threatened.<$FFFC>
You mustn't give up on her...<$FFFE>
UUuu...,<$FFFC>
Just a little longer...<$FFFE>
Diehärte.....,<$FFFC>
we have to hurry and safe her...<$FFFE>
She is in mortal danger....<$FFFE>
We have to rescue her and thwart the revival of Chaos...<$FFFD>
I cannot fight anymore....<$FFFE>
No...I can't abandon everyone like this...<$FFFE>
Grrr!<$FFFC>
The power of the demon kind has grown excessively...<$FFFE>
I'm afraid...I can't help you to rescue her....<$FFFE>
Damn...this!<$FFFC>
There's still so much to fight for!<$FFFC>
Diehärte!<$FFFE>
Don't ever abandon the ones you love...<$FFFC>
You must carry on in my stead....<$FFFE>
Chaos mustn't be allowed to soil this world...<$FFFE>
Never let them go....Diehärte....<$FFFE>
Cripes.<$FFFC>
To be able to fight Altemüller openly is such an uplifting sensation.<$FFFE>
I just wonder if Paul has completed the preparations by now....<$FFFE>
Anyway, playtime is over.<$FFFC>
From now this is serious!<$FFFE>
Forgive me, Diehärte...<$FFFC>
I wasn't able to repay my debt...<$FFFE>
Hohoho!<$FFFC>
How delicious!<$FFFC>
At last Altemüller is no more!<$FFFD>
You others have lived long enough as well.<$FFFC>
Ah what a wonderful bloodbath this will be, slaughter them all!<$FFFD>
Hehehe!<$FFFE>
What is this?<$FFFC>
I can no longer see my hands...<$FFFE>
...Dammit!<$FFFE>
Are you alright, Altemüller!?<$FFFE>
Don't mind me.<$FFFC>
My death holds no significance.<$FFFD>
Just focus on finishing off Geier.<$FFFE>
Uuuu!<$FFFE>
Are you ok, Varna?<$FFFE>
I'd choose death over standing by while a battle needs to be fought..<$FFFD>
Forgive me...<$FFFE>
It is alright.<$FFFC>
I did what needed to be done.<$FFFC>
You can rest now...<$FFFE>
May your spilled blood strengthen lord Chaos!<$FFFE>
Ua..rgh..how could...I...<$FFFE>
No matter,...when lord Chaos arises..he will bring me back...<$FFFE>
I had...hoped for a festival of slaughter...most regrettable...Uarrgh!<$FFFE>
We've got no time to waste.<$FFFC>
Let's hurry onwards!<$FFFE>
GOOOON!<$FFFE>
GUGAAAAA!<$FFFE>
GYAOOON!<$FFFE>
GYAOOON!<$FFFE>
GUGAAAAA!<$FFFE>
GUAAA....<$FFFE>
GUAAA....<$FFFE>
GUAAA....<$FFFE>

My body crumbles away...<$FFFE>
GOOOON!<$FFFE>
Guargh!<$FFFE>
ZKYAAAA!<$FFFE>
GAHAA!<$FFFE>
GAHAA!<$FFFE>
WOOO...<$FFFE>

ZKYAAAA!<$FFFE>
GAHAA!<$FFFE>
GAHAA!<$FFFE>
WOOO...<$FFFE>
What strength...<$FFFE>
Lord Chaos....!<$FFFE>
Disgusting humans....<$FFFE>
Wh..What!?<$FFFC>
The power of that sword is...inhuman....<$FFFE>
GYAOOON!<$FFFE>
GOOOON!<$FFFE>
GOOOON!<$FFFE>
GYAOOON!<$FFFE>
Come to our side Varna, come to your creator lord Chaos!<$FFFE>
Never!<$FFFC>
As long as I live I will stay by Altemüller's side!<$FFFE>
If that's so, you'll die along with all of them!<$FFFE>
Hehehe, now you'll pay for what you did to me that time!<$FFFC>
Today you'll die at my very own hands!<$FFFE>
Hmph!<$FFFC>
So I'll have to kill you again, how tedious.<$FFFE>
Lord Chaos will revive shortly.<$FFFC>
Delay the enemie's advance!<$FFFC>
Yessir!<$FFFE>
The age of darkness is dawning!<$FFFC>
Everything in this world shall be ours!<$FFFE>
<$FFFF>
