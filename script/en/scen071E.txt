Hmm, where should we head next?<$FFFE>
The royal capital of Larcussia?  Or, maybe the city of Laffel?<$FFFE>
Since Lord Raymond is working towards the liberation of Larcussia, he will likely be moving his troops there.<$FFFE>
So, why don't we make a return trip to Laffel?<$FFFE>
But, isn't that where the Dark Knight is?<$FFFE>
You think the Haja no Ken won't be enough to take him on?<$FFFE>
The Haja no Ken does possess extraordinary powers against demons.<$FFFE>
But, we shouldn't expect it to have many additional powers against foes such as him.<$FFFE>
Do we have the power to defeat the Dark Knight right now?<$FFFE>
Just because we plan on returning to Laffel doesn't mean we have to fight the Dark Knight.<$FFFE>
We might be able to get him to leave Laffel.<$FFFE>
Of course!<$FFFC>
If we can get that fiend to leave, we won't have to fight him!<$FFFE>
Even though it sounds too simple, we just need to drive the Dark Knight off elsewhere since we aren't strong enough to beat him!<$FFFE>
Hmm, I wonder.....<$FFFE>
No, instead of driving him out, we should try to lure him out.<$FFFE>
If the Kingdom of Barral is invaded first, the Dark Knight will be called from his station at Laffel to assist.<$FFFE>
Then, once we receive confirmation that the Dark Knight has left Laffel, we can march out and reclaim Laffel.<$FFFE>
........<$FFFE>
How do you respond?<$FFFE>
I see.<$FFFE>
I think I understand.<$FFFE>
You're incredible.<$FFFE>
I see, what a strategy.<$FFFC>
Such a profoundly thought-out plan.<$FFFE>
Right, I think I understand.<$FFFE>
You're incredible, Luna.<$FFFC>
Such an inspiration.<$FFFE>
However, we'll need someone to keep close watch on Laffel for this to work.<$FFFE>
But, if we're attacking the Kingdom of Barral, we won't have the troops to spare for watch duty....<$FFFE>
Leave that to me.<$FFFC>
I've got friends who can keep an eye on Laffel.<$FFFE>
I'll head to Laffel immediately.<$FFFE>
Wait, let me come too!<$FFFE>
No, it will be easier for me alone to elude the notice of our enemies.<$FFFC>
I promise not to make a mistake and get caught.<$FFFE>
I made a promise to Geriord, after all.<$FFFC>
I promised to restore his home town, Laffel.....<$FFFE>
Former Larcussia Royal Castle - Currently Imperial Headquarters<$FFFF>
You must be weary, Your Excellency.<$FFFE>
Indeed.<$FFFD>
What happened on the war front while I was gone?<$FFFE>
The strength of Lord Raymond's Larcuss patriots has grown.<$FFFD>
At present, General Bortz is ready to make an attack....<$FFFE>
So good old Bortz wants to reclaim his honor, eh.<$FFFE>
But, he doesn't have many soldiers with which to attack.<$FFFC>
General Bortz will probably be hard-pressed in the fighting.<$FFFE>
Hmm, the magically-propelled giant soldier, Galshook, has just arrived.<$FFFD>
There's no need to have Bortz squander his few troops in such fighting.<$FFFE>
....I've always thought this city looked lovely.<$FFFE>
Verily, it is so.<$FFFE>
I've talked it over with everyone, and all agree that this city is a perfect addition to the Empire.<$FFFD>
Such an abundant land would greatly invigorate the lives of the Empire's citizens....<$FFFE>
That's why we'll go wherever we must and endure whatever we must.<$FFFE>
Indeed.<$FFFC>
Everyone's counting on our success.<$FFFE>
