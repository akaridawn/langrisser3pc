Battle between the Captured Airship and the Airship escorting Lord Raymond<$FFFF>
Commander, the enemy has made preparations to board our ship!<$FFFE>
How on earth did they manage to get their hands on one of our airships!?<$FFFD>
Bah what do I care, we'll have to deal with them anyway!<$FFFC>
Without a doubt they are here to rescue the prisoner.<$FFFE>
Let's be off to the other side then.<$FFFC>
But don't look down or you'll get funny feelings inside the belly.<$FFFE>
Please try to end this fast, I don't feel too well.<$FFFE>
If you wish to conclude this battle quickly, target the enemy commander.<$FFFE>
Sir Diehärte.<$FFFC>
Let us commence the invasion of the enemy ship now.<$FFFC>
We shouldn't let time pass wastefully.<$FFFE>
Of course.<$FFFC>
I'll see to it right away.<$FFFE>
We have to hurry up.<$FFFC>
The boarding planks won't last forever.<$FFFE>
Oh my, I think I just heard one of the planks cracking.<$FFFC>
They won't last that much longer.<$FFFE>
We have already taken too much time.<$FFFD>
If we don't finish this soon, we'll also have to deal with enemy reinforcements.<$FFFC>
...That would be unpleasant...to say the least.<$FFFE>
The boarding plank is aching?<$FFFC>
It will come off any minute now.<$FFFE>
The enemy reinforcements are probably on their way by now.<$FFFC>
We have to fulfil our mission quickly and get out of here.<$FFFE>
The enemy will send airships from the base in Teito if we continue to waste so much time.<$FFFD>
If those reinforcements arrive we will be done for!<$FFFE>
The boarding planks came off!?<$FFFE>
Hahaha!<$FFFC>
Now there's no chance for you to escape any more.<$FFFD>
You came all the way here to free a prisoner and now you'll become captives yourself!<$FFFC>
Ahahahaha!<$FFFE>
I'm sorry everyone...<$FFFC>
I have failed you...<$FFFE>
I'm sorry everyone...<$FFFC>
I have failed you...<$FFFE>
Prow corpse reporting!<$FFFC>
They broke through our lines!<$FFFE>
<$F702><$F702>Central corpse reporting!<$FFFC>
The enemy is invading!<$FFFE>
What are you doing!?<$FFFC>
Stop them somehow!<$FFFE>
<$F703><$F703>Stern corpse reporting!<$FFFC>
The enemy has crossed our defensive lines!<$FFFE>
<$F704><$F704>Commence the counter-offensive.<$FFFC>
Invade the enemy's vessel!<$FFFE>
Upon inspecting the door thoroughly you notice a strange symbol attached to it.<$FFFE>
Do you want to take it?<$FFFE>
Magic Symbol was obtained!<$FFFE>
The symbol vanished...<$FFFE>
I can still...fight...<$FFFC>
You must continue...<$FFFE>
Papa....<$FFFE>
Here's what you get for messing with my friends family!<$FFFE>
I'm sorry, everyone...<$FFFE>
I gotta take a rest...<$FFFE>
It's hopeless...<$FFFE>
You tink you can win like this?<$FFFE>
Huh?<$FFFE>
Sorry...<$FFFE>
Lushiris...<$FFFE>
Guargh...<$FFFC>
Please carry on...<$FFFE>
Urgh...<$FFFE>
It should've been differently...<$FFFE>
Guargh!<$FFFC>
I won't die like this!<$FFFE>
How...laughable...<$FFFC>
...happening...on a simple escort mission...<$FFFE>
Your Commander has fallen!<$FFFC>
Put down your weapons and surrender quietly!<$FFFE>
Understood.<$FFFC>
We surrender...<$FFFE>
Way to go, Sir Diehärte.<$FFFE>
The battle is over...<$FFFD>
Now then, search the ship for Raymond!<$FFFE>
I still can....<$FFFE>
Gaurgh...<$FFFE>
My strength was not enough...<$FFFE>
Guarghh!<$FFFE>
I'm falling!<$FFFE>
Goodbye...<$FFFE>
They are too fast...<$FFFE>
If only the circumstances would've been different!<$FFFC>
But it doesn't matter anymore...<$FFFE>
Fighting is futile...if only I knew before...<$FFFE>
So this is it...<$FFFE>
Mother...I won't be coming home...<$FFFE>
My magic wasn't enough...<$FFFE>
Help me, God!<$FFFE>
Kyaaah!<$FFFE>
After I just got promoted...<$FFFE>
It's hopeless...<$FFFE>
Dying in mid-air, how poetic...<$FFFC>
I would not like to die!<$FFFE>
W..What!?<$FFFC>
All my troops have been wiped out!?<$FFFE>
It would have been more than enough to take out their commander.<$FFFC>
What is all this destruction good for...<$FFFE>
Keep the enemy at bay.<$FFFC>
Buy some time for our reinforcements to arrive!<$FFFE>
The Prow corpse is no more...<$FFFE>
The center corpse has been overthrown...<$FFFE>
Stern corpse...<$FFFC>
This has to be a nightmare!<$FFFE>
<$FFFF>
