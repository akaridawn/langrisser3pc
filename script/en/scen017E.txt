Barral Stronghold ~ Rogier<$FFFF>
Yaawn!<$FFFC>
So this is the stronghold!<$FFFE>
It is likely that this is the base for the invasion on Laffel.<$FFFE>
Yeah.<$FFFC>
When we launched our attack on Laffel we used this stronghold as headquarters.<$FFFE>
In other words, this fortress holds high importance to the whole invasion.<$FFFE>
That's right.<$FFFC>
If there would be an attack here, reinforcements would be sent from Laffel no doubt.<$FFFE>
I guess we all know what that means.<$FFFE>
Wouldn't this be a good opportunity to take out the Dark Knight for good and to begin a counter-offensive?<$FFFE>
No.<$FFFC>
For now our objective is distracting the enemy.<$FFFE>
If we aren't careful we could get into a pincer attack.<$FFFE>
I agree.<$FFFC>
Besides that Dark Knight fellow is one heartless monstrosity, cutting down his own men if he feels like it.<$FFFE>
...Damn!<$FFFC>
Just remembering it makes my stomach ache!<$FFFE>
It is time to commence the attack.<$FFFC>
Take the fortress with one dedicated charge!<$FFFE>
No Problem!<$FFFE>
Is there someone called Diehärte around here?<$FFFE>
That would be me.<$FFFE>
Wolf send me.<$FFFD>
You need to speed up your operation!<$FFFC>
The Dark Knight will arrive here shortly!<$FFFE>
Oh no, we must hurry sir Diehärte!<$FFFE>
Yeah.<$FFFC>
We have to fall back soon if we want to free Laffel.<$FFFE>
Aha!<$FFFD>
Once our reinforcements arrive you'll be done for!<$FFFC>
Don't think you'll get away from here easily!<$FFFE>
So that's how it is!<$FFFD>
Once our reinforcements arrive you'll be done for!<$FFFC>
Don't think you will get away from here easily!<$FFFE>
Now that they know our plan we have to silence them for good.<$FFFC>
We need to conclude this battle before the Dark Knight arrives.<$FFFE>
I'm at it.<$FFFE>
...Make haste.<$FFFC>
If the Dark Knight appears our only option will be to fight him!<$FFFE>
Sir Diehärte, we have to end this fast.<$FFFC>
If the Dark Knight arrives the outcome of the battle could be unfavorable.<$FFFE>
I know.<$FFFE>
Everyone, hurry!<$FFFC>
The dark knight is approaching!<$FFFE>
Now that the Dark Knight is here, our victory is certain!<$FFFD>
All troops, charge!<$FFFC>
Destroy the invaders!<$FFFE>
I see everyone is already enjoying themselves.<$FFFC>
What kind of incompetent maggot is responsible for this?<$FFFE>
The Dark Knight!?<$FFFE>
So he really came!<$FFFE>
...The remnants of the Larcuss army.<$FFFC>
Hmph...that's just perfect.<$FFFC>
I wanted to kill you for some time now.<$FFFE>
That's a worry, the Dark Knight arrived sooner than anticipated...<$FFFE>
No use complaining, we just have to defeat him and<$FFFC>
after that we will claim back Laffel!<$FFFE>
Defeat me...<$FFFC>
Amusing.<$FFFE>
-Defeat the Dark Knight<$FFFE>
The Dark Knight...<$FFFC>
What a fearful enemy.<$FFFE>
His power is clearly beyond what normal humans should be capable of.<$FFFE>
With our current strength we might not stand a chance against him...<$FFFE>
I'm sorry everyone.<$FFFC>
It just took too long to conquer the fortress...<$FFFE>
Alert!<$FFFC>
It is the enemy, the enemy attacked!<$FFFE>
What!?<$FFFC>
How many are there?<$FFFE>
They number approximately 1/3 of our troops.<$FFFE>
What fools!<$FFFC>
They must be mad believing to stand a chance with so few.<$FFFD>
All troops on battle station!<$FFFC>
Let them a taste the power of Barral!<$FFFE>
I'm outta here.<$FFFC>
It's getting too dangerous around here, good luck!<$FFFE>
Move in on the enemy!<$FFFC>
Don't let them get any further!<$FFFE>
Yessir!<$FFFE>
Advance.<$FFFE>
Yessir!<$FFFE>
Something weirdly shaped sticks out from behind the statue.<$FFFE>
What do you do?<$FFFE>
Destroy it<$FFFE>
Take it<$FFFE>
Stare at it motionless<$FFFE>
Nothing happened.<$FFFE>
You couldn't reach it...<$FFFE>
After some time of staring motionlessly, the statue begins to speak.<$FFFD>
If you wish for it to be yours, make an offer.<$FFFE>
How much do you offer?<$FFFE>
100P<$FFFE>
500P<$FFFE>
1000P<$FFFE>
That's not enough...<$FFFE>
Nothing happens.<$FFFC>
But your money is gone...<$FFFE>
That's not enough...<$FFFE>
Nothing happens.<$FFFC>
But your money is gone...<$FFFE>
That's not enough...<$FFFE>
But the thought is what counts.<$FFFC>
Take this!<$FFFE>
Crest of the Lord of Immortals was obtained!<$FFFE>
As you inspect the small stone pillar you realize that it's a gravestone.<$FFFD>
Suddenly a large migratory bird lands on the gravestone.<$FFFC>
In one of his claws it holds a gem that sparkles in seven colors.<$FFFE>
What do you do?<$FFFE>
Threaten the bird<$FFFE>
Reach out to it with your hand<$FFFE>
Ignore the bird<$FFFE>
Being surprise, the migratory bird flies off, leaving the gem behind.<$FFFE>
Divine Blessing was obtained!<$FFFE>
The migratory bird escaped with the gem...<$FFFE>
After a while the migratory bird flies off with the gem...<$FFFE>
I overestimated myself...<$FFFE>
Diehärte...<$FFFE>
I'm sorry...<$FFFE>
Coty...<$FFFE>
Oh...<$FFFE>
That's weird.<$FFFC>
I can't feel my body...<$FFFE>
Excuse me...<$FFFE>
Oh..I can see a light...<$FFFE>
My age caught up to me...<$FFFC>
Please be careful...<$FFFE>
Urrgh...<$FFFE>
Shii...<$FFFE>
How silly...<$FFFC>
The stronghold mustn't fall before...<$FFFE>
I failed...<$FFFD>
But even if I die this fortress will never fall!<$FFFD>
Dark Knight!<$FFFC>
Come quick!<$FFFE>
Hey, not bad!<$FFFE>
My compliments for making it so far!<$FFFE>
Not yet!<$FFFC>
We won't be defeated like that!<$FFFE>
Preposterous!<$FFFE>
This is not an end befitting a knight!<$FFFE>
Impossible, how did they make it so far!?<$FFFD>
We must old out until the reinforcements come!<$FFFE>
I'm supposed to know a spell against that condition...<$FFFE>
Life's such a waste of time...<$FFFE>
To die in such a dump...<$FFFE>
Crap!<$FFFE>
I can't bear the cruelty no longer!<$FFFE>
My body and this fortress are like tempered steel!<$FFFE>
I kinda saw it coming...<$FFFE>
I'm gonna pile up a mountain with your remains!<$FFFE>
M..My ballista jammed!<$FFFE>
So long...<$FFFC>
Death feels...nice...<$FFFE>
So this is where my journey ends...<$FFFE>
Fail...<$FFFE>
I never told you...<$FFFC>
Good bye...Elliot...<$FFFE>
I'm b.r.o.k.e.n...<$FFFE>
Urgh...<$FFFC>
They...broke through...<$FFFE>
Here they come!<$FFFC>
This is as far as you go!<$FFFE>
So I die...on my first deployment...<$FFFE>
I didn't expect that...<$FFFE>
You brute...<$FFFE>
The enemy is here!<$FFFE>
Those guys aren't your run of the mill soldiers!<$FFFD>
We have to think of something...<$FFFE>
So that's how dying feels like...<$FFFE>
Such...carelessness...<$FFFE>
W..What hit me!?<$FFFE>
...My body grows cold...<$FFFE>
Lay down your swords...<$FFFC>
We are defeated...<$FFFE>
If Rogier falls...<$FFFC>
The royal capitol will...<$FFFE>
That's my final mistake!<$FFFE>
I confess everything!<$FFFC>
Defeat tastes oh so bitter...<$FFFE>
Who is in command?<$FFFC>
I don't see anybody raising his hand, why's that?<$FFFE>
You worms dare to challenge me?<$FFFC>
Very well.<$FFFC>
Come and die!<$FFFE>
...So the remnants of Larcuss got some skill after all.<$FFFD>
...You there, Diehärte.<$FFFE>
Yes ?<$FFFE>
When we meet again the pleasure will be all mine...<$FFFE>
I..Impossible the Dark Knight cannot be defeated!?<$FFFD>
Those guys aren't human!<$FFFC>
All the troop retreat!<$FFFE>
I..Impossible the Dark Knight was defeated!?<$FFFD>
Those guys aren't human!<$FFFC>
All the troop retreat!<$FFFE>
Phew, somehow we managed to fend him off.<$FFFC>
That was some serious battle, I was really worried for a second.<$FFFC>
But all that matters is that we made it through.<$FFFE>
This is a well earned victory, Sir Diehärte.<$FFFE>
Sir Diehärte...<$FFFC>
That was a rather a pathetic performance.<$FFFD>
Diehärte you should leave commanding the troops to me...<$FFFE>
I never thought it was possible to beat that guy.<$FFFE>
With that kind of injury he won't be messing with us any time soon.<$FFFD>
Now we should hurry back to Laffel.<$FFFC>
Everyone, I know your tired but hang in there!<$FFFE>
I can't believe it...<$FFFE>
Hmph!<$FFFC>
That's it!<$FFFE>
Your luck has just run out!<$FFFE>
You're strong...<$FFFE>
Mommy!<$FFFE>
Blast!<$FFFE>
Our maneuver was a success!<$FFFC>
This is a well earned victory, Sir Diehärte.<$FFFE>
Sir Diehärte...<$FFFC>
That was a rather a pathetic performance.<$FFFD>
Diehärte you should leave commanding the troops to me...<$FFFE>
We did it...it's over.<$FFFC>
Now we should hurry back to Laffel.<$FFFE>
Everyone, I know your tired but hang in there!<$FFFE>
<$F703><$F703>Fu!<$FFFC>
The fortress mustn't fall at any cost!<$FFFE>
