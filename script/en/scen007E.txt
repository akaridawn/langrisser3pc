-Total destruction of the enemy<$FFFC>
-Successfully retreating with all allies to the opposite shore<$FFFC>
 after initiating combat between the Imperial and Barral forces<$FFFE>
-Death of [diehardt's name]<$FFFE>
Near the border between Barral and the Rigüler Empire<$FFFF>
We will carry out an attack on both the Barral and the Rigüler troops at the same time.<$FFFE>
Our goal is to lure both armies out and incinerate a battle amongst them.<$FFFE>
We shouldn't prolong our participation in this battle, since we could get into trouble when the main body of the armies arrive.<$FFFE>
Decisive battle of a short duration.<$FFFE>
To put it frankly, we anger them a little and then run away?<$FFFE>
That's child's play!<$FFFE>
Keep on applauding yourself for a victory you haven't won yet and our defeat will be certain!<$FFFE>
I'm sure we'll be just fine!<$FFFE>
Alright, begin the operation!<$FFFE>
We will show you the superior strength of us imperials!<$FFFE>
We will show you the superior strength of us imperials!<$FFFE>
We won't be defeated by the likes of you!<$FFFE>
Captain!<$FFFC>
Our main force was informed about the attack!<$FFFC>
The Dark Knight should be on his way while we are talking!<$FFFE>
Captain!<$FFFC>
Our main force was informed about the attack!<$FFFC>
The Dark Knight should be on his way while we are talking!<$FFFE>
Th..The Dark Knight!?<$FFFC>
Do you have any idea what you did!?<$FFFD>
If he arrives before we cleared up this mess, I'm as good as dead...<$FFFC>
Take down the imperials no matter what, the very life of your much-loved captain is at stake!<$FFFE>
General Varna!<$FFFE>
What is occurring here!?<$FFFC>
Explain this!<$FFFE>
As a matter of fact, Barral has started an invasion...<$FFFE>
In that case we have to teach them a lesson, no?<$FFFC>
Force them back!<$FFFE>
Still no reinforcements!?<$FFFE>
The messenger was send simultaneously with the discovery of the enemy.<$FFFC>
By now, their coming can be expected every minute.<$FFFC>
Once our main force arrives, our victory will be unconditional!<$FFFE>
What is this the meaning of this unsightly battle?<$FFFE>
Sir Dark Knight!<$FFFC>
The imperial soldiers have crossed the border...<$FFFE>
That man!?<$FFFC>
Is this the rumored Dark Knight!?<$FFFE>
You have taken your time with this opponent and I'm getting doubts about your usefulness.<$FFFE>
Sir [diehardt's name]!<$FFFC>
The Dark Knight has come.<$FFFC>
It will be very dangerous to stay here any longer.<$FFFD>
Please give the order to retreat right away!<$FFFE>
Understood.<$FFFC>
Everyone, we have to get out of here!<$FFFE>
That man must be Dark Knight of Barral!?<$FFFD>
At this point it probably is unreasonable to fight with the Dark Knight.<$FFFC>
For now we should hurry up and escape.<$FFFE>
Fend them off!<$FFFC>
After that, move out to crush Barral's forces!<$FFFE>
Intercept all advancing enemies!<$FFFC>
Take out every BArral soldier that comes into sight!<$FFFE>
Move out!<$FFFC>
Defend this border with everything you've got!<$FFFE>
Until his Excellency arrives, I will take command.<$FFFC>
We will charge at them full force!<$FFFE>f
Move out, slaughter everyone in your way!<$FFFE>
Ready up to retaliate!<$FFFC>
Drive out the imperials and you all will get a medal!<$FFFE>
Perfect, our plan is working!<$FFFC>
Everyone, retreat!<$FFFE>
That should be everyone, right?<$FFFE>
You have commanded us beautifully, Sir[diehardt's name].<$FFFE>
Sir [diehardt's name]...<$FFFC>
This battle took us much longer than it should have...<$FFFD>
This may have a negative influence on the next mission...<$FFFE>
Everything is set.<$FFFC>
However, we just managed to buy us some time.<$FFFD>
Let's hurry towards Lushiris Gate!<$FFFE>
Okay.<$FFFC>
Let's wait here for everyone to return.<$FFFE>
I've made it back.<$FFFC>
Everyone come quickly as well.<$FFFE>
*Huff*....<$FFFC>
Let us conclude our strategy by falling back.<$FFFE>
Please make it back to safety everyone...<$FFFE>
Alriight, that wasn't all that bad!<$FFFE>
It seems somehow I made it back safely.<$FFFC>
Please join up with swiftness.<$FFFE>
Once everyone returns here safely, this mission will be a great success.<$FFFC>
Do hurry if circumstances allow it.<$FFFE>
When you inspect the Tent, you come across an odd looking horn.<$FFFE>
Will you take it?<$FFFE>
The Gjaller Horn was obtained!<$FFFE>
Uwaaa!!<$FFFE>
Challenging the Empire like that; you insolent fools seem to forget who you are dealing with!<$FFFE>
And you have yet to experience the true might of the Barral Kingdom first hand!<$FFFE>
It seems we are doing well, Sir [diehardt's name].<$FFFE>
However, we should not push our luck, therefore it would be advisable to retreat now.<$FFFC>
Keep your eyes up for an opening and withdraw to the other side of the bridge.<$FFFE>
<$F702>Right!<$FFFC>
Screw you!<$FFFE>
<$F702><$F702>Don't be so gloomy!<$FFFE>
<$F702><$F703>Right!<$FFFC>
Screw you!<$FFFE>
<$F703><$F703>Don't be so gloomy!<$FFFE>
Have at you!<$FFFE>
What a thing to do!<$FFFE>
Kyaa!<$FFFE>
Wahh!<$FFFC>
That's impossible...load...now..<$FFFE>
Here I go!<$FFFC>
It's no use...<$FFFE>
Oh my, I didn't mean that to...<$FFFE>
I didn't expect this...<$FFFC>
Forgive me.<$FFFC>
You have to run away while you can!<$FFFE>
Guuaa!<$FFFE>
<$F704><$F704><$F704><$F704><$F704><$F704><$F704><$F704><$F704><$F704>う、腕が‥‥<$FFFE>
Barral is coming...<$FFFE>
M..Mercy...<$FFFE>
What folly!<$FFFE>
Uuu!<$FFFE>
Uuurg!<$FFFE>
You have chosen the wrong people to mess with!<$FFFE>
Guwwaa!<$FFFE>
The Empire isn't called the strongest military nation on all the continent for nothing!<$FFFC>
It would be an insult even comparing Barral's measly forces to ours!<$FFFE>
Th..That's...<$FFFE>
Iaaa!<$FFFE>
Do, die!<$FFFE>
That's the extent of my powers...<$FFFC>
It can't be helped.<$FFFC>
For now I just have to wait for his Excellency to arrive...<$FFFE>
That's the extent of my powers...<$FFFC>
It can't be helped.<$FFFC>
Until his Excellency arrives, all troops retreat!<$FFFE>
Hang in there!<$FFFC>
Regroup and prepare for the counterattack!<$FFFE>
You're that rumored Dark Knight!<$FFFC>
Let me try those alleged powers of yours!<$FFFE>
I have a thing for strong women.<$FFFC>
However, your mouth will get you only so far in battle!<$FFFE>
From now my actions will speak for themselves!<$FFFE>
Khe...<$FFFC>
Never would I have expected him to be that strong...<$FFFE>
Is that all one of the four generals is capable of?<$FFFC>
After all you are just great in numbers.<$FFFE>
Bastard...<$FFFE>
Gaaar!<$FFFE>
Guuurrg!<$FFFE>
Rats!<$FFFC>
Why here...<$FFFE>
I'll never drink before battle again...hic..<$FFFE>
So many regrets...<$FFFE>
I can't die...just yet...<$FFFE>
<$F705><$F705><$F705><$F705><$F705><$F705><$F705><$F705>Damn those imperial dogs!<$FFFE>
You bloody Imperials!<$FFFE>
If we fail here the Dark Knight will claim our lives.<$FFFD>
I'm not ready to die just yet!<$FFFE>
M..Mother...<$FFFE>
Uaaarr!<$FFFE>
Guurrg!<$FFFE>
Die, die, die!<$FFFE>
Please my lovely blood...stop flowing...<$FFFE>
Save me...<$FFFE>
Just my cursed luck!<$FFFE>
Wh..What!?<$FFFE>
I..can't die...like this...<$FFFE>
No good...<$FFFE>
I still had so high expectations for life...<$FFFE>
Guurgg!<$FFFD>
So that is the thing called pain...<$FFFD>
It's inevitable.<$FFFC>
Fall back and reorganize!<$FFFE>
Guurgg!<<$FFFD>
So that is the thing called pain...<$FFFD>
It's inevitable.<$FFFC>
Fall back and reorganize!<$FFFD>
All troops, retreat!<$FFFE>
Hey there, eyesore.<$FFFC>
Die!<$FFFE>
Kuuhhaa!<$FFFE>
All strength is leaving my body....<$FFFE>
After we came so far...<$FFFE>
Just a little while longer...<$FFFE>
Such might...<$FFFE>
What in the world is happening here!?<$FFFC>
All our troops have been annihilated!<$FFFE>
Never mind them.<$FFFC>
If they failed so they were destined to die, now head out and crush the enemy!<$FFFE>
Yessir!<$FFFC>
We will fight until we drop dead!<$FFFE>
Sir [diehardt's name].<$FFFC>
The Dark Knight of Barral has come!<$FFFC>
We have to retreat now!<$FFFE>
...I understand your worry.<$FFFC>
On the other hand I'm itching to cross swords with him.<$FFFD>
I've got to know how much I have improved!<$FFFE>
Sir [diehardt's name]...<$FFFC>
Please don't do anything unreasonable.<$FFFE>
Understood.<$FFFC>
I'll make sure to draw back if it's getting to dangerous.<$FFFE>
This man, is he the Dark Knight from Barral!?<$FFFD>
At this point I it would be more than daring to face him.<$FFFC>
Everyone retreat on the double!<$FFFE>
Th..This can't be happening!?<$FFFE>
Our whole frontline troops have been eradicated...<$FFFC>
There's no way Barral's troops could have done this on their own!<$FFFE>
You may be right, but that doesn't change the obvious fact that all our troops have been crushed.<$FFFD>
Until his Excellency arrives we just have to stall every enemy that comes into sight.<$FFFE>
All our troops have been annihilated!<$FFFC>
What kind of absurdity is this!?<$FFFC>
How could Barral acquire such power unnoticed?<$FFFE>
Hoo...<$FFFC>
It seems this could be getting enjoyable after all.<$FFFE>
The enemy!<$FFFC>
The enemy has launched an attack!<$FFFC>
Prepare the counterattack!<$FFFE>
Now where are those Barral cowards!?<$FFFE>
We will hit those bumpkins so hard, they won't even know where it came from!<$FFFE>
The enemy is approaching from the other side!<$FFFE>
The enemy is approaching from the other side!<$FFFE>
The Rigüler Empire has commenced an invasion!<$FFFE>
This is getting serious, Sir [diehardt's name].<$FFFC>
Reinforcement from the Imperial main force have shown up.<$FFFD>
With our current troops we stand no chance against them.<$FFFC>
We have to withdraw immediately!<$FFFE>
Understood.<$FFFC>
Everyone, hurry and retreat to the other side of the bridge!<$FFFE>
Reinforcement from the Empire's main force!?<$FFFC>
That's not good.<$FFFD>
Retreat to the other side of the bridge fast!<$FFFE>
Wow...<$FFFC>
I don't know how but we've defeated every single enemy.<$FFFE>
Your commanding during this mission deserves praise, Sir [diehardt's name].<$FFFE>
Sir [diehardt's name]...<$FFFC>
We spend too much time fighting.<$FFFD>
Our next mission could be negatively influenced by this...<$FFFE>
See as I predicted, it was an easy victory!<$FFFE>
Well!<$FFFC>
I guess fortune did smile upon us!<$FFFE>
<$F706><$F706>Well then, let us be on our way without further delay.<$FFFE>
That's right.<$FFFC>
We've just earned a bit of time.<$FFFC>
Onward to Lushiris Gate!<$FFFE>
That's right.<$FFFC>
We've just earned a bit of time.<$FFFC>
Let's press on to Lushiris Gate quickly!<$FFFE>
Our time has come!<$FFFC>
Charge!<$FFFE>
Move out!<$FFFC>
To the attack!<$FFFE>
We will tear you to pieces!<$FFFC>
Now you arrogant Barral air braggarts will be put back in your place!<$FFFE>
You damn imperials!<$FFFC>
Time for a ride!<$FFFE>
So I guess or strategy was a success in some way.<$FFFC>
We managed to incinerate a war between the Rigüler Empire and Barral Kingdom.<$FFFD>
On top of that we have broken their front lines thoroughly, a feat I haven't thought possible.<$FFFD>
But now it is time for us to get the hell out of here!<$FFFE>
