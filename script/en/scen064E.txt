Scenario - 12<$FFFC>
"Sage Fauvel"<$FFFE>
Now that [diehardt's name] and company have defeated Ferakia,<$FFFC>
Demon General of Velzerla, their path leads directly to<$FFFC>
the eastern gate, the providence of Sage Fauvel.<$FFFE>
But right when the party comes into sight of the eastern<$FFFC>
gate, the Imperial soldiers begin their invasion.<$FFFE>
*Condition for Victory<$FFFC>
 -Destroy all enemies in 14 turns<$FFFE>
*Conditions for Defeat<$FFFC>
 -Death of [diehardt's name]<$FFFC>
 -Death of Fauvel<$FFFC>
 -Time Up<$FFFE>
Plains Near the North Gate<$FFFF>
Bring it on!<$FFFC>
Don't come near unless you're resigned to death!<$FFFE>
Isn't that General Bortz!?<$FFFC>
Don't let him escape - the main enemy force will be here shortly!<$FFFE>
Don't waste the General's sacrifice!<$FFFC>
All units, move out!<$FFFC>
Head the opposite way and break through!<$FFFE>
All right, if I'm the only one they capture, my plan will have worked.<$FFFC>
....Now it's all up to me.<$FFFE>
Ugh,<$FFFC>
Uoooo!<$FFFE>
City of Laffel - Currently Occupied by Barral<$FFFF>
Ugh!<$FFFE>
Gwah!<$FFFE>
What are those four ships doing!<$FFFB>
<$FFFC>
They should have retreated some time ago!<$FFFE>
Sir, since they were covered with oil, they probably fear to decend any lower because of the threat of those fire arrows!<$FFFE>
Bah!<$FFFD>
Eh, why!?<$FFFC>
Why aren't they attacking!?<$FFFE>
We ruled the battlefield only up until the point that fiend came....<$FFFD>
So this is the power of the Dark Knight!<$FFFE>
Border between Colcia and the Rig・er Empire<$FFFF>
The Empire currently has their hands full fighting both Barral and the remnants of Larcuss.<$FFFD>
For now the Empire can't retaliate with their full strength!!<$FFFD>
Let's go!<$FFFE>
Here they come!<$FFFC>
Prepare to defend!<$FFFE>
They have too few to defend a national border of this size.<$FFFC>
We can break through with one strike!<$FFFE>
Nimrods!<$FFFD>
You imbeciles would recklessly attack the Empire's border when I'm around, would you...<$FFFE>
Ugh!<$FFFC>
Him....it can't be!<$FFFE>
His Excellency, the Field Marshal!<$FFFE>
Your unclean feet won't be allowed to soil the holy land of the Empire!<$FFFE>
Holy shit!<$FFFC>
With him leading the army, there's nothing we can do!<$FFFE>
Lushiris Gate ~ West Gate<$FFFF>
!?<$FFFB>
<$FFFC>
Grrrr....!?<$FFFE>
.....Gr!!<$FFFE>
We've finally found it.<$FFFC>
This is the temple of that guardian beast.<$FFFD>
All of you, spread out and search the perimeter of the temple!<$FFFE>
Yes, sir!<$FFFE>
