Lushiris Gate ~ Eastern Gate<$FFFF>
Father, are you all right?<$FFFE>
I'm unharmed,<$FFFC>
thanks to your brave intervention.<$FFFE>
I'm just glad we made it in time.<$FFFC>
But most importantly, is the gate safe as well?<$FFFE>
Yes, thanks to you<$FFFC>
it still shines with Lady Lushiris's light undeterred.<$FFFE>
So now we've liberated two of the gates.<$FFFE>
But, I'm concerned about the last two gates.<$FFFE>
Just a little while ago, the light from the west gate vanished.<$FFFC>
It's probably Barral's doing.<$FFFE>
We were late in coming because we ran afoul of the Empire on the way.<$FFFC>
My sincerest apologies.<$FFFE>
You must be soldiers sent by my Father.<$FFFC>
That must mean things are going well on his front.<$FFFE>
We will defend this place to our death!<$FFFC>
Please, leave this to us and hurry to liberate the western gate.<$FFFE>
Lord Raymond's battle with the Empire is still dragging on, so he doesn't have enough spare troops to liberate the western gate.<$FFFE>
Lord Raymond has headed to the northern gate, which is defended by the main Imperial forces.<$FFFE>
On the other hand, since the Imperial army has been tied up there, that's why it was so simple for us to recover this gate.<$FFFE>
Exactly.<$FFFE>
It seems that the demons have begun their invasion.<$FFFC>
We'd better hurry and restore the operation of the Lushiris Gate.<$FFFE>
After all we've only got one more gate to liberate.<$FFFE>
If that's what your planning, I'd like to come with you.<$FFFC>
I may be a bit senile, but I've still got a few tricks left.<$FFFE>
Fauvel joined the party!<$FFFE>
Your assistance is greatly appreciated.<$FFFE>
Well, everyone, let's get a move on.<$FFFE>
Plains Near the Northern Gate<$FFFF>
You must be Bortz's soldiers.<$FFFC>
....Hmm?<$FFFC>
But what happened to Bortz?<$FFFE>
So that we might escape, General Bortz charged the main enemy forces....,<$FFFC>
Taking on wave after wave of the enemy soldiers.....<$FFFE>
....I see.<$FFFE>
You all were blessed to have such a good commander, indeed....<$FFFE>
Don't count someone as dead til you've seen the body!<$FFFE>
!!<$FFFE>
Heh, so you all really did think I'd died!<$FFFE>
B..bortz!?<$FFFE>
General, we're so glad you made it back safely....<$FFFC>
What a relief......<$FFFE>
I'm damned glad to see you all safe, too.<$FFFC>
And don't you cry now, it's indecent.<$FFFE>
Sorry for troubling you Varna, but please look after my men for just a little while longer. Right now I'm feeling.....incredibly.....worn out.<$FFFE>
You can count on me.<$FFFE>
Phew......<$FFFE>

T..too powerful.....<$FFFC>
..<$fe><$19>..<$fe><$14>..<$fe><$f>..<$fe><$f>Guhaa!<$FFFE>
Hmm, that was hardly a challenge at all.<$FFFE>
Your Excellency, you were incredible.<$FFFC>
It looks like your swordsmanship is even stronger than before!<$FFFE>
My true struggle in that battle was<$FFFC>
convincing my stiff muscles to move.<$FFFD>
I leave the defense from here on in your hands, while I return to our base in Larcussia.<$FFFE>
Yes, sir!<$FFFE>
