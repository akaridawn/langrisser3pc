Master Bˆser....<$FFFE>
....What is it, Ferakia?<$FFFE>
My apologies!<$FFFC>
On the way, there was an unforseen intrusion, and I was unable to murder the sorceress.<$FFFE>
Even without the functionality of the Gate, some of that bitch Lushiris's power remains.<$FFFE>
It couldn't be helped, since I didn't grant you your original power.<$FFFE>
But, for you to have lost like this, it must have been quite a powerful party.<$FFFE>
...It's still no excuse for my defeat.<$FFFE>
No need to brood over a single failure.<$FFFC>
Hmmm, I wonder what we should do from now on....<$FFFE>
Plains Near the Northern Gate<$FFFF>
We're in deep shit now, totally surrounded.<$FFFE>
General Bortz, what should we do?<$FFFC>
Right now, it's only a matter of time before we're all wiped out.<$FFFE>
There's only one way you can escape the enemy surrounding us.<$FFFC>
Let me serve as a distraction at one end, and break through the other end to escape.<$FFFE>
!!<$FFFE>
But, General, we're your main troops - it only makes sense we'd stay here and fight.<$FFFE>
Yet, if they see me, and think the main troops have started to move away from me, they'll gather their troops in one place to crush me.<$FFFE>
But, with their army all concentrated in one place, you'll definitely be able to break through the weakened perimeter.<$FFFC>
All of you, use that opening and get out of here.<$FFFE>
But, General!<$FFFC>
If we do that.....!<$FFFE>
That fast horseman who came earlier brought me word that General Varna is sending a relief army.<$FFFE>
If you join up with Varna's army, Raymond's army won't be able to keep chasing you.<$FFFE>
General Bortz!<$FFFC>
Please don't place yourself in such danger!<$FFFE>
But, as things stand, if you stay with me any longer you'll all be wiped out.<$FFFE>
All of you must live to meet up with Varna!<$FFFC>
That's an order!<$FFFE>
....I'll leave the rest to you.<$FFFE>
