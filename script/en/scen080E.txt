Scenario - 20<$FFFC>
"Fighting in the Vast Skies"<$FFFE>
Since General Bortz fought to his last breath to let the majority<$FFFC>
of his subordinates escape, he gave a fierce accounting of
himself.  During that battle, he showed that even to his death,<$FFFC>
he was a true man.<$FFFE>
Having defeated Bortz and captured the skyboat,<$FFFC>
[diehardt's name] quickly set sail to rescue Lord Raymond<$FFFC>
from his convoy to the Empire.<$FFFE>
And now, a fierce battle was about to ensue in the vast skies.<$FFFE>
*Condition for Victory<$FFFC>
 -Defeat of the Commander in 29 turns<$FFFC>
*Conditions for Defeat<$FFFC>
 -Death of [diehardt's name]<$FFFC>
 -Time up<$FFFE>
Captured Skyboat<$FFFF>
Wow, it's fast, so fast!<$FFFE>
After seeing the strength of this skyboat and that magically-propelled giant soldier, I'm worried about what the Empire might use next.<$FFFE>
!!<$FFFE>
Sir [diehardt's name]!<$FFFC>
There's an Imperial skyboat up ahead!<$FFFE>
So we've caught up to it!<$FFFE>
Father's in there......<$FFFE>
Prepare the boarding plank.<$FFFC>
Soon as we touch their gunwale, we'll board them.<$FFFE>
Eh?!<$FFFC>
That's pretty reckless!<$FFFE>
Very much so.<$FFFC>
What if the ships should jostle apart while we're on the boarding plank....<$FFFE>
It's dangerous, but there's no other way.<$FFFC>
At this rate, if we let them into the Empire proper, we'll never be able to perform the rescue.<$FFFE>
Since this is an aerial battle, it would be wise to prepare aerial troops.<$FFFE>
That's right.<$FFFE>
Match speeds and move alongside them!<$FFFE>
<$FFFF>
