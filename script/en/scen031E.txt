Sir Dark Knight.<$FFFC>
Are we about to invade this town?<$FFFE>
That is correct.<$FFFE>
But it would seem that this town doesn't hold any strategic value.<$FFFE>
That may be so.<$FFFC>
It will serve to demonstrate the might of the Barral Kingdom<$FFFE>
and our unwavering determination to conquer all.<$FFFC>
We will think of its further use afterwards.<$FFFE>
Today we make clear to the world that nothing can compare to the power of Barral, just as King Wielder desires.<$FFFE>
To prove ourselves worthy we must strike swiftly and effectively.<$FFFE>
Certainly.<$FFFC>
Once the floodgate is broken our victory is assured.<$FFFE>
I see, that way the city will submerge.<$FFFC>
What a prudent plan.<$FFFE>
Then nothing remains...<$FFFE>
Enough idle talk, begin the maneuver.<$FFFE>
...Forward the orders Ruud.<$FFFE>
.....<$FFFE>
...All troops!<$FFFC>
The target is the floodgate.<$FFFC>
Spread out!<$FFFE>
Yessir!<$FFFE>
Hold it!<$FFFC>
We will not permit you to lay waste to this town!<$FFFE>
So we meet again Dark Knight!<$FFFE>
Sir Dios...<$FFFE>
Ruud?<$FFFB>
<$FFFC>
...it has been a long time.<$FFFE>
Change of orders.<$FFFD>
Ruud you lead the front-line unit and stop the enemy's advance.<$FFFC>
Mobile units flank the enemy.<$FFFE>
Yessir.<$FFFE>
<$fe><$14>‥<$fe><$1e>‥<$fe><$1e>‥。<$FFFE>
What are you doing Ruud!<$FFFD>
He may once was your superior but now he's nothing more than a traitor.<$FFFC>
As such you will strike him down without hesitation.<$FFFB>
<$FFFC>
...Move out.<$FFFE>
Prepare Yourself Dark Knight!<$FFFE>
Are you ready for me?<$FFFC>
If not you will pay the ferryman soon.<$FFFE>
That goes without saying! <$FFFE>
Geriord...<$FFFB>
<$FFFC>
Why, Geriord...<$FFFE>
Now I understand what they are up to!<$FFFC>
The enemy plans to open the flood gate!<$FFFE>
What!?<$FFFC>
If the Floodgate was destroyed it would mean the end for this town.<$FFFE>
Right.<$FFFB>
<$FFFC>
We mustn't allow this to happen!<$FFFE>
What!<$FFFB>
<$FFFC>
Could they really commit an act of such cruelty?<$FFFE>
If they open the flood gate, this whole town will be in peril!<$FFFE>
Right.<$FFFB>
<$FFFC>
Could they really commit an act of such cruelty?<$FFFE>
Sir Dios.<$FFFC>
After all it seems I too committed a terrible error.<$FFFD>
Listen, our objective is to destroy the floodgate to make this town submerge.<$FFFE>
What?!<$FFFD>
Crap!<$FFFC>
Just how low has the Barral Kingdom fallen?<$FFFE>
...They want Barral to be feared.<$FFFC>
It is due to the king's own wish.<$FFFE>
What absurdity.<$FFFC>
Aren't we soldiers to protect our people? Slaughtering all those civilians is what you vowed to prevent, not to cause.<$FFFD>
We cannot allow this town to fall into their hands...<$FFFE>
Ruud.<$FFFC>
Are you aware of what you just did?<$FFFD>
Leaking information to the enemy is treason.<$FFFE>
Sir Ruud!?<$FFFC>
Do you understand what do just did?<$FFFD>
What it means to leak information to the enemy?<$FFFE>
...I'm well aware of what it means.<$FFFE>
SO you did it intentionally and fully aware of the consequences.<$FFFD>
You are hereby branded a traitor!<$FFFE>
...Me a traitor...<$FFFE>
The front line units have been engaged in combat!<$FFFE>
All troops move out.<$FFFE>
Yessir!<$FFFE>
That can't be...<$FFFE>
....<$FFFC>
I wonder, is this truly the righteous way to life...<$FFFE>
Diehärte...<$FFFE>
What is it, Dios?<$FFFE>
I'm concerned for my former subordinate Ruud.<$FFFC>
Are you worried about going to battle with him?<$FFFE>
That's quiet right.<$FFFC>
Maybe I can bring him back to his senses somehow.<$FFFE>
Alright, we'll leave him to you then.<$FFFE>
Ruud advance!<$FFFE>
...Yessir!<$FFFE>
Something funny is going on.<$FFFC>
Ruud face looks like he is brooding over something.<$FFFD>
Maybe it's about the enemy tactics...<$FFFE>
[diehardt's name]!<$FFFC>
The floodgate was broken!<$FFFE>
Damn!<$FFFC>
Protecting the floodgate takes top priority!<$FFFE>
We didn't pay enough attention!<$FFFC>
Protect the floodgate!<$FFFE>
It's been a while Ruud.<$FFFE>
...Sir Dios.<$FFFE>
Just how long do you plan to stick with those guys?<$FFFE>
One man alone can go his own way.<$FFFD>
But I could not sacrifice my wife for my own desires.<$FFFC>
...there's little chance to escape the resulting persecution.<$FFFE>
....<$FFFE>
In the end, one who leaves behind his wife to run away is nothing but a coward.<$FFFE>
I don't think so.<$FFFD>
Taking the opportunity to run away to stay true to oneself is certainly better than losing oneself and becoming a disfigured person.<$FFFD>
...This would be what the person that loves you couldn't endure more than anything else.<$FFFE>
Thank you.<$FFFC>
Your words have restored you a little in my eyes.<$FFFE>
Ruud why did you leak information to our enemy?<$FFFC>
Do you care for your family so little?<$FFFE>
Protecting my family is the very reason I became a soldier.<$FFFC>
I never to slaughter innocent people.<$FFFD>
But if you betray us, you know what'll happen to your family, right?<$FFFE>
It's too late to turn back now anyway.<$FFFC>
I lay my fate into the hands my new comrades.<$FFFC>
We simply must throw down the Dark Knight!<$FFFE>
Sir Dios...<$FFFE>
Ruud.<$FFFC>
Don't you care about your family? <$FFFE>
....Ugh!<$FFFD>
Are you so quick to forget the oath you made?<$FFFC>
Your methods have become intolerable!<$FFFC>
From now on I'll follow Dios's way!<$FFFE>
...I see.<$FFFC>
Throwing away pride for survival is the path of the weak-minded!<$FFFC>
Thank you, Sir Dios.<$FFFE>
If it's completely broken this town will be doomed!<$FFFE>
Stop this madness!<$FFFE>
There's no time left!<$FFFE>
Now Barral's might shall be known far and wide!<$FFFE>
We have failed...to protect..the people of this town.<$FFFE>
You come across a large gravestone.<$FFFC>
It is inscribed with ancient letters that say:<$FFFD>
"Seven ramparts and the great witch sleep here."<$FFFE>
Do you want to offer up a prayer?<$FFFE>
Suddenly a you hear a voice from unknown origin.<$FFFD>
"Those who call out my name<$FFFC>
shall be granted power".<$FFFE>
What do you say?<$FFFE>
Media<$FFFE>
Sukasaha<$FFFE>
Shihu<$FFFE>
Nothing happened.<$FFFE>
When you speak the name Sukasaha a magic circle appears on the ground.<$FFFC>
From below a book rises and floats right into your hands.<$FFFE>
The book of Sukasaha was obtained!<$FFFE>
Nothing happened.<$FFFE>
After all we still have to fight each other.<$FFFE>
It can't be helped.<$FFFC>
We are enemies now!<$FFFE>
I won't hold back!<$FFFE>
Let's see if your skill can match mine!<$FFFE>
It pains me to have to do battle with a former subordinate.<$FFFC>
But it seems, there's no other way than to beat some sense into you!<$FFFE>
Only a fool would dream of defeating me.<$FFFE>
I'm sorry, everyone!<$FFFE>
...I'm sorry General...<$FFFE>
Don't be modest now.<$FFFC>
Move on with all your power!<$FFFE>
This town has to be saved...<$FFFC>
Uuhh...<$FFFE>
Huh?<$FFFC>
I don't have anything else to say...<$FFFE>
...Oh. That was quiet good.<$FFFE>
You are just one strong person but we draw upon a different power!<$FFFE>
The strength that comes with comradeship!<$FFFC>
With it your defeat is already a certainty!<$FFFE>
You're just a bunch of rebels to me.<$FFFC>
I will show you how helpless you really are!<$FFFE>
Awww...what a waste...<$FFFE>
Uwaaah!<$FFFC>
I'll be more careful next time...<$FFFE>
The enemy...is upon us...<$FFFE>
I'm so sorry for what I did!<$FFFC>
What a strange twist of fate!<$FFFE>
Why does this happen so soon...<$FFFC>
I didn't think my strength was this...meh....<$FFFE>
I'm sorry for failing in the hour of need...<$FFFE>
Ahh, I'm done for..good luck to you...<$FFFE>
Despicable!<$FFFC>
Be respectful to your elders...<$FFFE>
GURRRRR...<$FFFE>
Dammit!<$FFFC>
That Dark Knight guy..is...<$FFFE>
Diehärte, you have to bring down the Dark Knight...<$FFFE>
You are the only one who can stop him now!<$FFFE>
I'm sorry, I can't...<$FFFE>
Mistake!<$FFFC>
What a terrible mistake!<$FFFE>
Uugh!<$FFFE>
Ruud!<$FFFE>
Sir Dios!<$FFFC>
You always have been my idol...<$FFFD>
You're a bit rough around the edges but your concern for your subordinates is exemplary.<$FFFD>
When King Wilder changed, everyone else said nothing out of fear but you stood up and acted.<$FFFE>
It's alright...<$FFFC>
Don't speak anymore...<$FFFE>
Sir Dios.<$FFFC>
My wife Remi...<$FFFE>
I know, don't worry.<$FFFC>
With that I can go in peace...<$FFFE>
Uugh!<$FFFE>
....<$FFFE>
After...all..I did..for Barral...I die..being branded as a traitor...<$FFFD>
Forgive me, Remi....<$FFFC>
I have been nothing but trouble to the end...<$FFFE>
...Ruud.<$FFFE>
Di..Dios.<$FFFC>
You always have been my idol...<$FFFD>
You're a bit rough around the edges but your concern for your subordinates is exemplary.<$FFFD>
When King Wilder changed, everyone else said nothing out of fear but you stood up and acted.<$FFFD>
I..never wanted to fight against you...<$FFFC>
It's thanks to you that I found courage in myself...<$FFFE>
You give me too much credit..<$FFFC>
It's alright to let go, Ruud.<$FFFE>
Remi...please take care of my wife...<$FFFE>
...Understood...<$FFFE>
Thank you for everything...you ever did for me...<$FFFE>
....<$FFFE>
After...all..I did..for Barral...I die..being branded as a traitor...<$FFFD>
All I ever did...was for the sake of my country..and for you, Remi...<$FFFC>
D-don't let them have their way...<$FFFE>
Understood, Ruud.<$FFFC>
You can struggle all you want.<$FFFE>
You all will follow him to the netherworld before long!<$FFFE>
Now I'm really pissed.<$FFFC>
I won't let you get away unpunished!<$FFFE>
...We mustn't be defeated.<$FFFC>
We will protect this town no matter what!<$FFFE>
Oh, what is this power...<$FFFC>
that could best even me...<$FFFE>
...this cannot...I...guarh..<$FFFE>
Geriord?<$FFFE>
...N..no way...<$FFFC>
Geriord was the Dark Knight all along...<$FFFE>
That can't be...<$FFFE>
...Just what is going on?...<$FFFE>
Please safe them!<$FFFC>
If the enemy isn't pushed down...!<$FFFE>
Ah..Arghh...<$FFFE>
Uoooh!<$FFFE>
This....I....<$FFFE>
Lucky...strike...<$FFFE>
I don't wanna...<$FFFE>
Forgive me...my daughter...<$FFFE>
Huh?...Am I dead....?<$FFFE>
I couldn't....<$FFFE>
Is that you god....?<$FFFE>
This was pointless....<$FFFE>
Uuhh...my conscience grows wide....<$FFFE>
Where's my sword...<$FFFE>
Excuse me....<$FFFE>
Please...stop...<$FFFE>
Long live the Barral Kingdom!<$FFFE>
Victory shall be ours!<$FFFE>
I'll just use a resurrection spell...later....<$FFFE>
This is not the way....Urgh!<$FFFE>
I....can't move....<$FFFE>
Uwaaaah!<$FFFE>
Good-bye my friends, it's hard to die!<$FFFE>
Heh, heeeergh!<$FFFC>
My death draws near....<$FFFE>
It's so cold....<$FFFE>
Cahrge!<$FFFE>
God abandoned us.....that figures.<$FFFE>
I'll never fly again...<$FFFC>
You better be ready for this!<$FFFE>
At least I'll die like a maaarrggh!<$FFFE>
Flood gate...Fl..ood..ga...<$FFFE>
Destroying...town..is...fun...<$FFFE>
...Uaahh!<$FFFC>
The Barral troops that were aiming at the gate are no more.<$FFFD>
This destruction...<$FFFE>
Silence!<$FFFC>
Join as one and attack!<$FFFE>
...Hmph, this is getting interesting.<$FFFD>
Come and give it a try!<$FFFE>
We will protect this town with our very lives!<$FFFE>
The units dedicated to destroy the gate was wiped out...<$FFFD>
No matter, we'll have to kill everyone around by ourselves than, even though it's slower...<$FFFE>
What are you doing from here on out Ruud?<$FFFE>
I left Barral behind me but not my family.<$FFFC>
I'll have to protect them with my own hands.<$FFFD>
...this I can do because of your help.<$FFFE>
I see.<$FFFC>
Good luck to you Ruud.<$FFFE>
Thank you.<$FFFE>
I left Barral behind me but not my family.<$FFFD>
I'll protect mine and you must seek out the origin of this mess by moving on to the royal family.<$FFFE>
I see.<$FFFC>
Let's all give our best.<$FFFE>
Yes.<$FFFC>
Thank you very much.<$FFFE>
Die, you traitor!<$FFFE>
Dammit!<$FFFC>
How can I be bested?<$FFFE>
At ease.<$FFFC>
Take good care of your family.<$FFFE>
What!?<$FFFE>
...At last it's over..<$FFFE>
Your command was magnificent [diehardt's name].<$FFFE>
[diehardt's name]...<$FFFC>
We spend to much time fighting.<$FFFD>
This will influence our further progress...<$FFFE>
I'm relieved we were able to save this town.<$FFFE>
[diehardt's name].<$FFFC>
Finally we were able to stop the Dark Knight.<$FFFE>
...Yeah.<$FFFE>
General Dios.<$FFFD>
I would only be a hindrance to all of you.<$FFFD>
May this spear will prove useful to you in my stead.<$FFFE>
I would only be a hindrance to all of you.<$FFFD>
May this spear will prove useful to you in my stead.<$FFFE>
Gae Bolg was obtained!<$FFFE>
I would only be a hindrance to all of you.<$FFFD>
Unfortunately I have nothing to give you.<$FFFD>
But know that my prayers will be with you.<$FFFE>
....Ruud.<$FFFC>
Show them what the true Spirit of Barral is.<$FFFD>
As you once promised to Remi.<$FFFE>
Traitor.<$FFFC>
Prepare to receive your punishment!<$FFFE>
Don't make me laugh Dark Knight!<$FFFC>
I won't forgive you for mistreating my subordinates!<$FFFD>
Today you'll regret, being so full of yourself!<$FFFE>
You coward will eat those words soon!<$FFFE>
<$FFFF>
