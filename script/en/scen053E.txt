!!<$FFFE>
Hmmph!<$FFFE>
Your Excellency!<$FFFE>
With the Dark Knight as your opponent, you're in for a rough time....<$FFFE>
But, his foe looks quite formidable too.....<$FFFE>
....Impressive, you're just as strong as the rumors say.<$FFFC>
This is my first time fighting against a foe this strong.<$FFFE>
.....Dastardly fiend.<$FFFC>
Let's end this now.<$FFFE>
Uooo!<$FFFE>
Aaaagh!<$FFFC>
The river!<$FFFE>
The bridge will not persevere!<$FFFB>
<$FFFC>
Your Excellency, it's too dangerous!<$FFFC>
Please come back!<$FFFE>
Sir Dark Knight!<$FFFE>
Bah!<$FFFE>
We'll have to postpone our duel.<$FFFC>
.....Bleh!<$FFFE>
Your Excellency!<$FFFC>
Are you all right, Your Excellency!?<$FFFE>
Don't just stand there! Quickly, get him to a doctor!<$FFFE>
....Ugh!<$FFFE>
Sir Dark Knight!<$FFFE>
Lushiris Gate ~ Center<$FFFF>
This is the first time I have laid eyes on this place.<$FFFC>
Are you the great sorceress, the Lady Jessica?<$FFFE>
Yes, I am Jessica.<$FFFC>
I don't know about the "great sorceress" part.<$FFFE>
Anyhow, what purpose draws you to this place?<$FFFE>
We are fighting against the Rigüler Empire and Barral, in order to restore the Kingdom of Larcuss.<$FFFD>
We've come to ask you to lend your power to our cause, Lady Jessica.<$FFFE>
Your two enemy countries are both quite strong.<$FFFB>
<$FFFC>
...However, they are not your only foes.<$FFFE>
Who else have we overlooked?<$FFFE>
In the land to the northeast of Larcuss, there is a kingdom of demons, called Velzeria.<$FFFD>
Protecting against the invasion of those demons is the very reason for the Lushiris Gate to be standing here, but....<$FFFD>
With the invasion of the Empire and Barral, some of the four gates that supply this place have been occupied.<$FFFD>
That's why the Lushiris Gate has ceased functioning.<$FFFE>
Then, if the Gate does not resume functioning soon.....<$FFFE>
The divine protection of Lushiris, the goddess of light, will no longer hold on this land.<$FFFD>
So, it's only a matter of time before Velzeria....and the demons invade.<$FFFE>
With us already fighting against the Empire, and Barral, we hardly can afford to have another foe nipping at our heels.<$FFFE>
So then, what is to be done?<$FFFE>
If we can free the four gates and occupy the land on which they stand, the power of the Lushiris Gate will be renewed.<$FFFE>
I see.<$FFFC>
We should collaborate with [diehardt's name]'s forces to free the four gates.<$FFFE>
Lord Raymond!<$FFFC>
Please send me as the messenger to [diehardt's name]!<$FFFE>
Lady Layla!?<$FFFE>
With everyone fighting, I'm the only one who has nothing to offer here!<$FFFE>
...Very well.<$FFFC>
Bring this message to him.<$FFFD>
I'm counting on you.<$FFFE>
Thank you, milord!<$FFFE>
In the mean time, I will tell you where the four gates can be found.<$FFFE>
