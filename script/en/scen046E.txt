Scenario - 03<$FFFC>
"The Blademaster with Sad Eyes"<$FFFE>
The portion of the Rigîêer Imperial Army led by Field Marshal Altemîêler<$FFFC>
which had captured the "floating fortress" used this fortress to exact<$FFFC>
tributary payment from Larcuss's capital city, Larcussia; as a result,<$FFFC>
Larcuss Kingdom was virtually ruined.<$FFFE>
But, [diehardt's name], Tiaris, and Layla, having made good their escape<$FFFC>
to the heart of Viscount Raymond's feudal domain, muster troops there,<$FFFC>
polish their strategy to retake the kingdom's capital, and bide their time<$FFFC>
for a counterattack.<$FFFE>
Now, half a year has passed since the fall of the floating fortress; the<$FFFC>
troops are in order, and the day for carrying out the plan has come.<$FFFE>
[diehardt's name], entrusted with the command of an independent force, has<$FFFC>
gone on a journey to win over the aid of Strategos Torrand. On the way,<$FFFC>
he takes a path by a village inhabited by a man bearing the title of Blademaster.<$FFFE>
*Conditions for Victory<$FFFC>
 -Defeat of Grove<$FFFC>
*Conditions for Defeat<$FFFC>
 -Death of [diehardt's name]<$FFFC>
 -Death of all the villagers<$FFFE>
Viscount Raymond's Manor<$FFFF>
Hmm.<$FFFC>
We've managed to amass an army.<$FFFE>
But, in doing so already half a year has passed...<$FFFC>
Much longer than I had initially hoped.<$FFFE>
Ah well, nothing to be done about it now.<$FFFE>
It's a miracle we were able to gather any soldiers at all, especially under the scrutiny of the spies of the surrounding countries.<$FFFE>
However, Lewin,<$FFFC>
Times will be even tougher from here on out.<$FFFC>
Half a year is hardly a short period of time.<$FFFD>
During that span of time, through the predations of many countries, the kingdom of Larcuss is no more.<$FFFD>
We have not even begun to face the true ordeal of rebuilding the kingdom from nothingness.<$FFFE>
Yes, Father.<$FFFE>
But, if we don't put our plans into motion, those who would revive the country will have no chance to do so.<$FFFE>
Weren't a lot of people captured during the fall of Larcussia?<$FFFD>
Including [diehardt's name]'s father and mother....<$FFFE>
So you've been worried about them as well, haven't you...<$FFFC>
Thank you, Tiaris.<$FFFE>
....You're quite right.<$FFFC>
We've been able to amass a fair army.<$FFFE>
But, we still lack in commanders.<$FFFC>
There should be another place besides my own which has retained its sovereignty through isolation.<$FFFE>
Its leader, Baron Torrand, is said to be a genius strategist.  If we allied with him, we would be set.<$FFFE>
So, [diehardt's name].  Will you join Lewin and Tiaris in securing the cooperation of Baron Torrand?<$FFFE>
Yes, sir.<$FFFE>
In the mean time, I will command the army we've gathered thus far and fulfill the first step in our plan by driving out the invaders from Colcia.<$FFFD>
It will be a good test of our strength to see how we fare against the Colcian troops.<$FFFD>
Once you've secured the Baron's aid, I'd like you to support my main troops as you see fit, commanding a mobile diversion force.<$FFFE>
You wish me to take command of a mobile division?<$FFFE>
My, what's wrong, [diehardt's name]?<$FFFC>
Why aren't you approaching this task with your usual enthusiasm?<$FFFE>
It's just that I don't have much experience with actual fighting.<$FFFC>
All I ask is that you do your best.<$FFFE>
Will you do this for me?<$FFFE>
..<$fe><$3c>..<$fe><$28>..<$fe><$28>..<$fe><$28>.<$FFFE>
Very well.<$FFFD>
We shall head off to Baron Torrand's land immediately.<$FFFE>
I'm counting on you all!<$FFFE>
Highway Near Ransh Village<$FFFF>
Say, [diehardt's name]-san.<$FFFE>
Do you mind if we make a short stop before we make our way to Baron Torrand's place?<$FFFE>
Something in this village you want to see?<$FFFE>
Well, a while back I heard something from my father abnout a blademaster named Gilbert who lived in this village...<$FFFE>
Ah, I see!<$FFFC>
Lewin-kun, didn't you say something also about knowing such a man?<$FFFE>
Indeed.<$FFFC>
He's the kind of man who's respected for his honor as well as his strength.<$FFFE>
....Hmmm.<$FFFD>
Sure, there's no reason we don't have the time to try to meet such a person.<$FFFE>
Ransh Village - Blademaster Gilbert's House<$FFFF>
Excuse me.<$FFFC>
Is Master Gilbert in at present?<$FFFE>
Who is it?<$FFFE>
I am Lewin, son of Viscount Raymond.<$FFFE>
The son of Viscount Raymond, you say?<$FFFC>
Ah yes, the Lord Viscount who rules that mountainous region.<$FFFE>
At present, the invasion begun by the Empire has been followed up by raids by many countries, so that little remains of the kingdom of Larcuss.<$FFFD>
Lord Raymond is gathering an army to restore the kingdom of Larcuss.<$FFFD>
In such times, we would be most honored if you who have earned the title of Blademaster would join with us and lend your power to our cause.<$FFFE>
I know nothing of a...Blademaster.<$FFFC>
....You speak of times past.<$FFFE>
But we seek to protect our land of Larcuss from the grasp of the invaders!<$FFFC>
I beg of you, please aid us!!<$FFFE>
I'm sorry, but I've vowed to never wield a blade again....<$FFFE>
....Such sad eyes.....<$FFFE>
Very well, I won't press you further for your reasons.<$FFFE>
Nothing we say can ever change what has already come to pass.<$FFFC>
I guess we're finished here.<$FFFC>
...It no longer matters to me.<$FFFE>
...a Blademaster, eh....?<$FFFD>
If I were really the Blademaster they called me, how could I have gotten you involved.....<$FFFD>
..<$fe><$3c>..<$fe><$3c>Forgive me,<$fe><$3c>Coty..<$fe><$3c>..<$fe><$3c>.<$FFFE>
So this is the place.<$FFFC>
Because of the ley lines here, it is said that dead bodies decompose less quickly.....<$FFFE>
Hee hee hee, I see now.<$FFFC>
From here it looks like I can create some powerful servants.<$FFFE>
And with the servants I create here, I'll be able to kill that sorceress for sure!<$FFFC>
Hee hee hee!<$FFFE>
Oh, those who have fallen!<$FFFC>
Heed the call of the masterful Necromancer Grove!<$FFFE>
Mihari Kushizakiki Iyokana Hagujisoramu!<$FFFE>
Beautiful!<$FFFC>
Such perfect undead!<$FFFE>
Uwaaa!<$FFFC>
O..o...o..oh no!<$FFFE>
Oho, so you saw me, did you.<$FFFC>
While I have no choice...<$FFFD>
I prefer to see this as a golden opportunity...<$FFFC>
Now I get to see just how strong my servants are!<$FFFD>
So, you servants!<$FFFC>
See if you can kill all the humans in this village!<$FFFE>
