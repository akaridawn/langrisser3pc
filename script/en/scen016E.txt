-The enemy snatches the Haja no Ken<$FFFE>
Estool Ruins<$FFFF>
Is this the place?<$FFFC>
Where tons of treasure are slumbering?<$FFFE>
We must be the first visitors since ancient days!<$FFFC>
What a stroke of luck!<$FFFE>
Leave the small fry alone!<$FFFC>
We are here to get something major.<$FFFC>
Is that clear?<$FFFE>
Jackpot!...look at this amazing sword!<$FFFE>
So this is where the holy sword is supposed to be at?<$FFFE>
Correct.<$FFFC>
It is not known to publicity but conveyed for generations by members of the nobility.<$FFFD>
So that when demons invade it could be used again.<$FFFE>
Never minding that, it seems that we aren't the only ones interested in this place!<$FFFE>
Ahh, Thieves!<$FFFE>
Boss!<$FFFC>
Some soldiers are heading this way!<$FFFE>
And it could've been such a nice day...<$FFFC>
Just make sure to get that sword, it will be enough loot.<$FFFD>
Once we get ahold of that sword we will make a run for it!<$FFFE>
Right!<$FFFE>
How unfortunate.<$FFFC>
The thieves seem to be after the sword also.<$FFFE>
That sword is essential for us!<$FFFC>
We have to secure it whatever it takes!<$FFFE>
This place is very narrow, doing battle will be complicated.<$FFFE>
Unless we move diligently the thieves will get away with all the treasure.<$FFFE>
You're right.<$FFFE>
Oy, riff-raff, listen up!<$FFFC>
Snatch everything that you can and make your escape!<$FFFC>
We'll meet at the usual place!<$FFFE>
Gotcha Boss!<$FFFE>
Cover our comrades!<$FFFD>
Move out you scumbags!<$FFFE>
Such a divine sword...<$FFFC>
It would sell for millions!<$FFFE>
The Haja no Ken was obtained!<$FFFE>
What is this sword!?<$FFFC>
It couldn't be any common article!<$FFFD>
You son of a...!<$FFFC>
You're cheating!<$FFFD>
Make your escape before those guys get the chance to surround us!<$FFFE>
The Haja no Ken was obtained!<$FFFE>
Piss off!<$FFFC>
That's my precious!<$FFFD>
It's no use...<$FFFC>
If I only can get away victory will be mine!<$FFFE>
With my special sword...<$FFFE>
Hey you! Just look how poor and innocent I am!<$FFFC>
Would I ever take what's not mine? Certainly not!<$FFFD>
Damn I have to escape before I get surrounded!<$FFFE>
You'll never get me alive!<$FFFE>
Sir Diehärte.<$FFFC>
If we don't hurry he will run off with the sword!<$FFFE>
I know!<$FFFE>
At this rate we'll lose him!<$FFFE>
There's only little time left!<$FFFE>
Sir Diehärte!<$FFFC>
The thief is escaping!<$FFFE>
I'm at it!<$FFFC>
If he escapes from here we won't be able to catch up to him!<$FFFE>
I got it!<$FFFE>
Jajajaja!<$FFFC>
Treasure, shiny treasure!<$FFFE>
Divine Blessing was obtained!<$FFFE>
No all I have to do is run!<$FFFE>
But the treasure chest was a mimic.<$FFFE>
It's a mimic!?<$FFFC>
Shit!<$FFFE>

Stealing from thieves, can you believe those guys!?<$FFFE>
But the treasure chest was a mimic.<$FFFE>
Damn!<$FFFC>
That's not fair!<$FFFE>
I hate he world!<$FFFE>
The Crystal Ankh was obtained!<$FFFE>
Lady Fortuna smiles upon me today!<$FFFE>
But the treasure chest was a mimic.<$FFFE>
C'mon.<$FFFC>
You've gotta be kidding...<$FFFE>
The Crystal Ankh was obtained!<$FFFE>
Suckers!<$FFFC>
You're too slow!<$FFFE>
But the treasure chest was a mimic.<$FFFE>
Huh!?<$FFFC>
How laughable...<$FFFE>
I'm going back to my moms place...<$FFFE>
The notorious Magical Bikini was obtained!<$FFFE>
But the treasure chest was a mimic.<$FFFE>
Now that's plain cheap...<$FFFE>
The notorious Magical Bikini was obtained!<$FFFE>
Uhhh that's just perfect!<$FFFC>
I'm outta here!<$FFFE>
But the treasure chest was a mimic.<$FFFE>
Whaaat!?<$FFFC>
I can't bare the frustration!<$FFFE>
The kind sack was obtained!<$FFFE>
It was the right decision coming here.<$FFFE>
But the treasure chest was a mimic.<$FFFE>

The power glove was obtained!<$FFFE>
Hmm.<$FFFC>

Grrr!<$FFFC>
What a waste of space!<$FFFE>
The power glove was obtained!<$FFFE>
Hooray!<$FFFC>
I found something good!<$FFFE>
But the treasure chest was a mimic...<$FFFE>
Oh great.<$FFFC>
This went fantastic!<$FFFE>
Now make my day and kick my...<$FFFC>
But you'll have to catch me to do so!<$FFFC>
So long!<$FFFE>
It's not too late...<$FFFC>
To get away...<$FFFE>
Dammit!<$FFFC>
My tactics have failed me...<$FFFE>
I'll remember this!<$FFFC>
One of these days you'll regret this!<$FFFE>
This treasure is mine!<$FFFC>
See you!<$FFFC>
You're in big trouble now!<$FFFE>
Dammit!<$FFFC>
My tactics have failed me...<$FFFE>
Dang!<$FFFC>
I thought I'd make big money!<$FFFE>
My deal has been busted!<$FFFC>
So long!<$FFFE>
Dammit!<$FFFC>
My tactics have failed me...<$FFFE>
Thanks for the loot!<$FFFC>
Hehe...<$FFFE>
I'm off to town to make some major sales!<$FFFC>

Dammit!<$FFFC>
My tactics have failed me...<$FFFE>
This place is so tiresome!<$FFFC>
I'm outta here!<$FFFE>
I still can't believe I made it through!<$FFFC>
Today is a good day!<$FFFE>
Damn!<$FFFC>
My tactics have failed me...<$FFFE>
It's no use crying over the treasure...<$FFFC>
Guess my life is a treasure itself...<$FFFE>
In front of you there is a door with a painting of a giant.<$FFFC>
There are two switches on that door.<$FFFE>
Which switch do you want to push?<$FFFE>
Black switch<$FFFE>
Red switch<$FFFE>
None<$FFFE>
When the black switch is pushed, the door to the right side opened.<$FFFC>
There is a vestment which shines weirdly.<$FFFE>
The vestment of the darkness was obtained!<$FFFE>
The door closes and the switches stop moving.<$FFFE>
When the red switch is pushed, the door to the left side opened.<$FFFC>
A dagger comes flying at you and scratches your arm.<$FFFE>
Apart from The Painless nothing was obtained!<$FFFE>
The door closes and the switches stop moving.<$FFFE>
Surrounded by trees you find an image of an old man.<$FFFC>
The old man holds a small bow and arrows in his hands.<$FFFE>
Do you want to try to take up the image?<$FFFE>
It seems to be just a common image.<$FFFE>
Suddenly the image begin to talk.<$FFFD>
"Call my name and you shall be granted power."<$FFFE>
Which name do you want to say?<$FFFE>
Masamune<$FFFE>
Chaos<$FFFE>
Odin<$FFFE>

The image disappeared...<$FFFE>
"You shall receive this bow and arrow for your wisdom."<$FFFE>

A metallic rusted plate lies on the small vacant land.<$FFFE>
Do you want to pick it up?<$FFFE>
The moment you touch it, the rust crumbles and a beautiful shield emerges!<$FFFE>
Achilles Shield was obtained!<$FFFE>
I couldn't...<$FFFC>
Still you must...<$FFFE>
Papa...<$FFFE>
Everyone, forgive me...<$FFFE>
So this is my strengths limit...<$FFFE>
It's no use...<$FFFE>
Don't hit me...<$FFFE>
I'm sorry...<$FFFE>
Lushiris take me in...<$FFFE>
Urg...<$FFFC>
Please carry on...<$FFFE>
urrgh...<$FFFE>
This was inevitable...<$FFFE>
They are too strong...<$FFFC>
Guaarr...<$FFFE>
Haja no Ken was obtained!<$FFFE>

Boss!<$FFFE>
What?<$FFFE>
Save my soul...<$FFFE>
Well?<$FFFC>
Is that my blood?<$FFFE>
Wait a minute, I didn't do anything bad...<$FFFE>
I shouldn't have gotten drunk yesterday...<$FFFE>
Blood, sweat and tears, what divine mixture...<$FFFE>
We should be able to take on the Empire and Barral with our current strength.<$FFFE>
That takes care of the thieves.<$FFFE>
The Haja no Ken was obtained!<$FFFE>
Thanks to your adaptive commanding, Sir Diehärte.<$FFFE>
However, we let some of the thieves escape.<$FFFC>
Even though they are small fry it would've been better to take care of them...<$FFFE>
Even apart from its uses against demons the Haja no Ken is a sword of high potency.<$FFFC>
Use it with mindful.<$FFFE>
So with its help we possibly could stand up against the Empire and the Barral Kingdom, no?<$FFFE>
Maybe so.<$FFFC>
In addition to that you all have gained in strength considerably.<$FFFE>
Yes, our division is growing more accustomed to real battle day by day.<$FFFE>
I'll continue to count on all of you.<$FFFC>
Everyone, please keep on lending me your strength for the battles ahead!<$FFFE>
