Velzeria Castle ~ Before the Castle Gates<$FFFF>
So this is the Velzerian Castle, huh?<$FFFE>
I assume so.<$FFFC>
The demonic aura around here is staggering.<$FFFE>
I'm here for the first time, but according to what Lady Lushiris has conveyed to me this has to be it.<$FFFE>
So the Prince of Darkness Böser is around here too?<$FFFE>
Most certainly.<$FFFE>
Let's give that Böser fellow a good trashing and be outta here!<$FFFE>
I'm afraid that is not going to happen.<$FFFE>
That voice!<$FFFE>
We are surrounded!<$FFFC>
How come we didn't noticed?<$FFFE>
Suits me fine!<$FFFC>
That way they save us the trouble of chasing after them.<$FFFE>
Quiet overconfident, aren't we?<$FFFE>
I admit, I'm slightly impressed you managed to defeat Ferakia.<$FFFC>
But this time the circumstances are a bit different, no?<$FFFE>
It's the same thing!<$FFFC>
We defeated her, we'll defeat you and then we'll finish off that Böser character!<$FFFE>
Is that so?<$FFFC>
They say you need 3 times the soldiers to take this castle.<$FFFE>
But you are just a handful; are you telling me that you believe you can win at such odds?<$FFFE>
That's exactly what I'm saying!<$FFFE>
Say, that talk about 3 times the soldiers was a bluff right?<$FFFE>
I'm afraid not.<$FFFC>
It is basic strategic knowledge that one needs approximately 3 times the troops to conquer a well armed defensive position.<$FFFD>
In other words, what he was saying was quiet accurate.<$FFFE>
What!?<$FFFC>
In case you didn't notice, THEY have 3 times our troops!<$FFFE>
Now keep it cool, we're only talking about numbers here.<$FFFC>
We'll just take them on one by one, if we stick together that minor difference in numbers won't matter much.<$FFFE>
Hehehehe!<$FFFC>
You amuse me, but let's see if you can keep up with your boasting!<$FFFE>
Come perished ones, rise again and haunt the living! <$FFFD>
Kimo Jinihi Kushi Zekiki Yokana Haguji Soramu!<$FFFE>
Whaa?<$FFFC>
All the monster's corpses have come back to life?<$FFFE>
I'm glad you like it, considering this such a simple task for my humble self to perform.<$FFFE>
Enjoy your miserable life, for it won't last any longer, Grove!<$FFFE>
Dammit!<$FFFC>
We have been surrounded once again!<$FFFE>
Umm, Sir Diehärte.<$FFFD>
Since they have been resurrected, I think it would be best using Holy and Fire magic against them.<$FFFE>
...<$FFFD>
Yeah, you've got a point there.$FFFC>
Let's give it a try.<$FFFE>
GUGAAAA!<$FFFE>
Hehehe.<$FFFC>
You're struggling hard, but how long can you keep that up?<$FFFE>
A powerful looking sword sticks out from the ground.<$FFFD>
There are letters carved into the floor next to it.<$FFFD>
"Name the greatest sword on earth and I shall lend you my power."<$FFFE>
What do you say?<$FFFE>
Langrisser<$FFFE>
Muramasa<$FFFE>
Alhazard<$FFFE>
The sword crumbled to dust...<$FFFE>
Under heavy sounds you were able to draw the sword out.<$FFFE>
Muramasa was obtained!<$FFFE>
The sword crumbled to dust...<$FFFE>
In front of you gasps a small hole. Inside it a bottle filled with deep-red liquid can be seen.<$FFFE>
Do you want to pick up the bottle?<$FFFE>
To reach it you have to to a narrow hole and probably will hurt your hand.<$FFFE>
What do you do?<$FFFE>
Grasp it securely<$FFFE>
Try pinching it<$FFFE>
Leave it alone<$FFFE>
You managed to take the bottle, but got injured.<$FFFE>
<$f6>Protection<$fc>You have lost 10 health points.<$FFFE>
Ghost Blood was obtained!<$FFFE>
As you attempt to carry the bottle out, it slipped away.<$FFFD>
The bottle broke and the liquid went to waste...<$FFFE>
Suddenly the earth begin  to tremble.<$FFFC>
The bottle broke and the liquid went to waste...<$FFFE>
Suddenly the earth begin  to tremble.<$FFFC>
The bottle broke and the liquid went to waste...<$FFFE>
Why does it has to end like this...<$FFFE>
Ouchie!<$FFFE>
Father...<$FFFE>
Grove...you bastard...<$FFFE>
Oh don't make such a sad face.<$FFFD>
I shall put his body to good use.<$FFFC>
Hihihihi....<$FFFE>
Ughh...<$FFFE>
Gilbert...<$FFFE>
Everyone...<$FFFC>
I'm soo tired...<$FFFE>
Oh...<$FFFE>
Sir Diehärte...<$FFFE>
Oh, Lushiris..help your poor children...<$FFFE>
Sophia...<$FFFE>
Father please don't overexert yourself.<$FFFE>
No...not now...<$FFFE>
Guaah...<$FFFE>
What a failure!<$FFFE>
Come on...try a little harder...<$FFFE>
Ahh, Heaven feels nice...<$FFFE>
Curse..you...<$FFFE>
So it has come to this at long last.<$FFFE>
You're the last of Velzeria's Generals to draw breath!<$FFFE>
This time you won't get slip away!<$FFFE>
Now now, please don't be so repellent.<$FFFE>
Just think about what magnificent zombie I could craft from flesh such as yours?<$FFFC>
Hihihihi!<$FFFE>
Ughh...those...Ignoramus...<$FFFC>
No human could....command such power...<$FFFE>
It's gotta be....that sword...<$FFFC>
Master Bösaaarrgghh...<$FFFE>
Coty...<$FFFC>
Your tormentor is no more.<$FFFE>
You can sleep peacefully now and dream the endless dream.<$FFFE>
It seems that all other demons have disappeared as well.<$FFFE>
Has anyone else noticed just how powerful we've become?<$FFFE>
With that all of the Velzerian Generals have been defeated by our own hands...<$FFFE>
This battle went only well because of your prudent commanding, Sir Diehärte.<$FFFE>
Sir Diehärte...<$FFFC>
Please concentrate on the ongoing battle....<$FFFD>
If we waste to much time the enemy can only benefit from it....<$FFFE>
KISYAAAH!<$FFFE>
KISYAAAH!<$FFFE>
KISYAAAH!<$FFFE>
KISYAAAH!<$FFFE>
KISYAAAH!<$FFFE>
KISYAAAH!<$FFFE>
GYAAAA!<$FFFE>
GYAAAA!<$FFFE>
GYAAAA!<$FFFE>
GYAAAA!<$FFFE>
GUGOOO!<$FFFE>
GOOON!<$FFFE>
GOOON!<$FFFE>
GUGOOO!<$FFFE>
Is that my fate...<$FFFE>
Such sweet pain...<$FFFE>
SYAAAH!<$FFFE>
SYAAAH!<$FFFE>
GWAAAAA!<$FFFE>
GWAAAAA!<$FFFE>
GWAAAAA!<$FFFE>
Guaaarg...<$FFFE>
Simpletons...<$FFFE>
Sniff*...<$FFFC>
I go back to..black...<$FFFE>
Feel my wrath!<$FFFE>
You humans are to be loathed...<$FFFE>
Why did you invade our home country...<$FFFE>
PUSYUUU!<$FFFE>
PUSYUUU!<$FFFE>
Now all that's left is to storm the castle!<$FFFC>
Do you still plan to fight on!?<$FFFE>
Now your all alone Groove!<$FFFC>
Do you still plan to fight on!?<$FFFE>
Hehehe!<$FFFC>
It's to early for you to celebrate a victory you haven't won yet.<$FFFE>
Is that a sore loser speaking?<$FFFC>
But no matter, your time is running short anyway!<$FFFE>
KYAAAAH!<$FFFC>
They killed all of my precious minions simply like that....<$FFFD>
You'll pay...you'll pay dearly!<$FFFE>
You ignorant humans have no sense for quality corpses!<$FFFC>
How dare you slay my beloved underlings!<$FFFE>
Grove.<$FFFC>
Underestimating the strength of us humans will prove a baneful fallacy!<$FFFE>
Now you will witness our power first hand!<$FFFE>
<$FFFF>
