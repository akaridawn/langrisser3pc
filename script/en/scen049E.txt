Have your wounds healed, Varna?<$FFFE>
My thanks for your concern, Your Excellency.<$FFFC>
Up until now I have been just a source for worry,<$FFFC>
but I have recovered now.<$FFFE>
That's wonderful.<$FFFC>
I don't know how I could continue to live without you.<$FFFE>
Your Excellency!<$FFFC>
...Please, do not jest so.<$FFFE>
Anyhow, does it look like the armies of Lord Raymond and Colcia are still fighting?<$FFFE>
Yes, and somehow it looks like the Colcian army is being pressed back.<$FFFE>
Excuse my interruption!<$FFFE>
I have a report to offer.<$FFFD>
While General Gaiel pursued the escaped prisoners, he ran across some armed Larcussians near Baron Torrand's land.<$FFFD>
From their apparent route, it looks like they are trying to meet up with Baron Torrand.<$FFFE>
Imagine that.  Gaiel giving us new information while he hunts...<$FFFD>
You have done well.<$FFFC>
Take a much-earned break.<$FFFE>
Yes, sir!<$FFFE>
The genius strategist, Baron Torrand, eh...<$FFFE>
Emaillink.<$FFFC>
Using your cavalry, go and attack the Baron's manor and this...mobile Larcuss division.<$FFFE>
It will be difficult to capture them if they're on the run...<$FFFC>
..but I wonder what will be the best way to attack the Baron's manor..<$FFFE>
Might I employ the skyboat for this task?<$FFFE>
I don't believe it would stand up well against the heavy mountain winds.  The land route should be faster.<$FFFC>
You should be able to make it in time if you use your cavalry.<$FFFD>
...and if you get a chance to see how well he lives up to this reputation for genius strategy, go for it.<$FFFE>
I shall save it for later use, then.<$FFFC>
My thanks for this opportunity.<$FFFD>
Farewell.<$FFFE>
Bortz!<$FFFB>
<$FFFC>
I leave the matter of Lord Raymond in your hands.<$FFFD>
Strike when they are at their weakest, right after they defeat the Colcians!<$FFFE>
Yes, sir!<$FFFC>
If the circumstances have changed, I'll use my best discretion.<$FFFE>
Then head on out!<$FFFE>
