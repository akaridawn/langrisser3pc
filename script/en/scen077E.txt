....Looks like we've managed to lose our pursuers.<$FFFE>
However, to have defeated the Galshook was no mean task....<$FFFE>
Whatever, even if it was crafted using incredibly ancient technology, it was still made by humans.<$FFFC>
And whatever is made is destined to be broken sometime.<$FFFD>
Nonetheless, it did a good job of cutting down our foe's soldiers.<$FFFE>
What shall we do from here on out, General Bortz?<$FFFE>
We'd better get the hell out of here.<$FFFD>
For now, we need to evacuate our soldiers and carry off our equipment to the airship base.<$FFFC>
The time has come to return to headquarters.<$FFFD>
No point in taking further casualties here.<$FFFC>
We can counterattack after we've managed an orderly retreat.<$FFFE>
Roger that.<$FFFD>
With you commanding us, General, I'm certain we'll run into no difficulties in our retreat.<$FFFE>
Hey now, don't think that flattery will get you promoted any faster!<$FFFE>
Of course not, surely you jest, sir.<$FFFD>
I simply meant to express the pride I've learned by serving in General Bortz's army!<$FFFE>
........<$FFFD>
I've been damned fortunate to have subordinates like you, too.<$FFFD>
Alright!<$FFFC>
Now that's been decided, make preparations for the withdrawal!<$FFFE>
Yes, sir!<$FFFE>
Larcussia Defense Perimeter ~ Imperial Frontline Base<$FFFF>
General Bortz....<$FFFC>
He was a formidable opponent.<$FFFE>
Boss, we've just gotten some news!<$FFFE>
Well done.<$FFFD>
So, what's the story?<$FFFE>
Listen to this.<$FFFD>
We found out that Lord Raymond was wounded grievously and captured with ease by the Empire.<$FFFE>
Well, I'm glad that he's at least safe.....<$FFFE>
Also, it looks like they plan on sending him to the Imperial capitol by airship once he's recuperated.<$FFFE>
In that case, we don't have any time to waste.<$FFFE>
Well, for now I think we should continue to pursue the routed General Bortz.<$FFFD>
He wasn't a weak foe this last battle, and I'm afraid what he'll try next after that attack using the magically-propelled giant soldier.<$FFFD>
If we let him regather his scattered troops, we'll be in trouble.<$FFFE>
I was going to say the same thing.<$FFFE>
I feel badly for Lewin, but I think it would be best if we'd hurry and continue our pursuit.<$FFFE>
.......<$FFFE>
What do you say?<$FFFE>
We should consider Lewin's feelings.<$FFFE>
We've no choice........<$FFFE>
That's right.<$FFFE>
Why don't we offer a little more consideration for Lewin's feelings?<$FFFE>
I hate to say it, but we really don't have time for skittishness or dickering around.<$FFFD>
We're at war, are we not?<$FFFC>
And you've said yourself that we're working to restore our former homeland.<$FFFE>
If it were just me, I'd be strongly against abandoning someone who seems in such dire straits.<$FFFD>
But, if the Empire's power returns to its peak, many more people.....<$FFFE>
....So this is war......<$FFFE>
.......Yes.<$FFFE>
Hmm.....<$FFFB>
<$FFFC>
I think if we move quickly enough, we should be able to overtake General Bortz.<$FFFD>
But, Lewin.<$FFFC>
Don't let it get you down.<$FFFE>
We'll definitely give our best shot at rescuing Lord Raymond.<$FFFC>
And after that, we'll work to restore this country!<$FFFE>
The two of you have it right.<$FFFC>
We'll stick to our earlier plan and chase down General Bortz for now.<$FFFE>
..<$fe><$28>..<$fe><$f>..<$fe><$f>..<$fe><$f><$FFFE>
Well then, I'll trust you to keep watch until they start moving Lord Raymond to the Imperial capitol.<$FFFE>
No problem.<$FFFC>
If anything changes, I'll get word to you ASAP.<$FFFD>
Farewell.<$FFFE>
Alright, time for us to head out, too!<$FFFE>
