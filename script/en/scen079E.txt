The Captured Skyboat<$FFFF>
Can't we rescue Lewin-san's father with this?<$FFFE>
Yes.<$FFFB>
<$FFFC>
But......<$FFFE>
Cheer up!<$FFFC>
I'm sure we'll make it in time!<$FFFE>
I'm afraid our foes might have other skyboats around.<$FFFD>
Imperial soldiers will seek to strike at us from the skies as we approach.<$FFFE>
Lewin......<$FFFE>
What do you say?<$FFFE>
Leave it to me!<$FFFE>
It'll all turn out alright.<$FFFE>
All we can do is give it our best shot.<$FFFE>
Leave it to me!<$FFFC>
I'm sure we'll be able to save Lord Raymond.<$FFFE>
....Sure.....<$FFFE>
I understand how you're feeling all too well.<$FFFD>
But, it will all turn out alright.<$FFFC>
Trust in us all.<$FFFC>
I promise we'll manage to save Lord Raymond!<$FFFE>
Everyone,<$FFFC>
...Thanks so much.<$FFFE>
You shouldn't give up until we've at least given it a shot.<$FFFE>
................<$FFFE>
Get ready to launch!<$FFFE>
Alright!  Let's get a move on!<$FFFD>
It's time to rescue Lord Raymond!!<$FFFE>
Former Larcussia Royal Castle - Presently Imperial Headquarters<$FFFF>
It's past time to have escorted Lord Raymond to the Imperial capitol.<$FFFC>
Why don't we return there tomorrow evening.....<$FFFE>
I'll consider it.<$FFFE>
Excuse me, I have a report.<$FFFD>
At the conclusion of General Bortz's clash with those Larcuss forces, his army was annihilated!<$FFFE>
Say what!<$FFFE>
What about Bortz?<$FFFE>
.......While his troops escaped via skyboats, he stayed and died an honorable death......<$FFFE>
General Bortz.......<$FFFE>
....You've done well.<$FFFC>
Please, leave us now.<$FFFE>
Yessir!<$FFFE>
So he became a human shield for his troops, eh.<$FFFC>
He stayed true to form even up to his death.<$FFFE>
.....We've lost a truly valuable man.<$FFFE>
Your Excellency Altem・ler.<$FFFC>
What shall we do?<$FFFE>
That company's morale is high now, and they will likely head here soon.<$FFFE>
......Hmmm.<$FFFE>
Gaiel!<$FFFC>
Take the aerial fortress and return to the Imperial capitol.<$FFFE>
They will probably have some use for you there.<$FFFE>
Yes, sir!<$FFFE>
So that group has defeated Bortz.<$FFFC>
We can no longer afford to treat them lightly.<$FFFE>
Muster all our forces and crush them.<$FFFE>
