Scenario - 27<$FFFC>
"Doppleganger Ferakia"<$FFFE>
Ferakia's attempt to throw Elthlied into chaos by taking<$FFFC>
the form of a royal claimant was easily seen through<$FFFC>
thanks to the power of the holy sword, the Langrisser.<$FFFE>
[diehardt's name] and company have taken this<$FFFC>
chance to start their journey to Velzeria to overthrow<$FFFC>
the leader of the demons, Bˆser.<$FFFE>
However, in a swamp on the way, the Doppleganger<$FFFC>
Ferakia lay in wait, hoping for a chance to blot out the<$FFFC>
dishonor of her last defeat.<$FFFE>
*Condition for Victory<$FFFC>
 -Defeat of Ferakia<$FFFC>
*Condition for Defeat<$FFFC>
 -Death of [diehardt's name]<$FFFE>

Grr!<$FFFE>
Opposition is futile!<$FFFE>
Eeii!<$FFFB>
<$FFFC>
Finishing style, Shitsufuuzan! (Rapid Wind Death)<$FFFE>
Milord!<$FFFD>
Milord!<$FFFC>
Answer me!<$FFFE>
Ugh......<$FFFC>
Gu..guhuu!<$FFFE>
Ahaha!<$FFFB>
<$FFFC>
Now this country is finished!<$FFFE>
H..how vexing....<$FFFE>
Milord!<$FFFE>
You're too late.<$FFFC>
Since you only reached here now, you were too slow to protect your ward!<$FFFE>
Worthless wretch!<$FFFC>
Unprincipled villainess!<$FFFE>
Bah!<$FFFC>
You actually managed to wound me.....<$FFFE>
But, whatever.<$FFFC>
Since this country is no more, it matters not that you live as the sole survivor!<$FFFE>
Milord.....my humble apologies!<$FFFE>
My lord, you kept me in your service for so long, yet I failed to protect not only your wife and only son, Shoutarou, but also you.....<$FFFE>
..<$fe><$3c>..<$fe><$3c>..<$fe><$3c>Milord,<$fe><$3c><$FFFC>
I, the dishonored Kirikaze, wish to postpone committing seppuku for a little while longer.<$FFFE>
Please, let me live in shame until I defeat Your enemy, that sorceress!<$FFFE>
Road to Velzeria<$FFFF>
..<$fe><$3c>..<$fe><$3c>..<$fe><$3c>..<$fe><$3c>..<$fe><$3c>.<$FFFE>
What's wrong, Kirikaze?<$FFFE>
..<$fe><$3c>..<$fe><$3c>..<$fe><$3c>..<$fe><$3c>Sir,<$FFFC>
it's nothing, nothing at all.<$FFFD>
I was just recalling the days of yore.<$FFFD>
....Anyways, it seems to have gotten colder.<$FFFC>
Velzeria must be only a little farther.<$FFFE>
Our scouts have returned.<$FFFE>
I see.<$FFFC>
So, what's the word?<$FFFE>
They report sightings of monsters in the marshland ahead.<$FFFD>
The marshland is covered with snow.<$FFFC>
It's the perfect place for an ambush.<$FFFE>
They'll probably take advantage of that.<$FFFC>
Apparently we haven't defeated them enough times to route them yet.<$FFFE>
Au contraire, the facts would suggest that they are desparate, as this is their last chance.<$FFFE>
They're eager to reach Velzeria.<$FFFE>
Hmm......<$FFFE>
What do you say?<$FFFE>
But, it'll be fine.<$FFFE>
We need to be careful.<$FFFE>
We might be in over our heads.<$FFFE>
But, we'll be fine.<$FFFC>
Everyone, cheer up!<$FFFE>
That's right.<$FFFE>
Yeah!<$FFFC>
Tia will also do her best!<$FFFE>
As you wish.<$FFFE>
We'll be fighting on a battleground of their choosing.<$FFFC>
We need to be very careful.<$FFFE>
Indeed.<$FFFE>
As you wish.<$FFFE>
This time, it looks like we might be in over our heads.....<$FFFE>
No way, [diehardt's name]-san!<$FFFC>
What are you saying!?<$FFFE>
That's right.<$FFFC>
Aren't you our commander?<$FFFE>
Really!<$FFFC>
This isn't like you at all, [diehardt's name]!<$FFFE>
....S..sorry......<$FFFE>
