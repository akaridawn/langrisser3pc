Scenario - 24<$FFFC>
"The Field Marshal's Determination"<$FFFE>
Velzeria, country of monsters, has begun a full-scale invasion.<$FFFC>
The mobile division was defending the border villages but got a<$FFFC>
high priority recall because of the Empire's attack on the royal capitol.<$FFFE>
But, who will ultimately win in this battle between three foes -<$FFFC>
the Empire, Velzeria, or Larcuss?<$FFFE>

Rig・er Imperial Castle - Paul's Personal Room<$FFFF>
So, now that my father's died, it's my turn to take the throne.<$FFFE>
But, Altem・ler seems more popular within the court here.<$FFFE>
How shall we deal with those fools expected to oppose us?<$FFFE>
Let's just give Altem・ler no margin for error if he blunders again.<$FFFE>
And when he does.....I'll call for his death.<$FFFE>
This plan might take some time before it can be hatched.<$FFFC>
But, it gives me such a rush.<$FFFC>
Hahahaha!<$FFFE>
