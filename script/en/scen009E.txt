Southern Lushiris Gate<$FFFF>
Shika! Shika!<$FFFE>
Do Kahni Champion!<$FFFC>
Someone coming!<$FFFE>
Shika!<$FFFC>
Who're you?<$FFFC>
What you coming for?<$FFFE>
Wow, who are those guys!?<$FFFE>
They must be the native people from the south that lived there since the old days.<$FFFE>
This is odd.<$FFFC>
Usually they don't come to this area.<$FFFE>
But it seems like the southern gate has been occupied by these people.<$FFFE>
Shika!<$FFFC>
This holy place of Shika tribe!<$FFFC>
You not allowed at holy place!<$FFFE>
This place is their holy place?<$FFFE>
It seems as if this area is an excellent spot for hunting.<$FFFD>
Long ago there even were some minor battles between Larcuss and the native people.<$FFFD>
They must have taken the opportunity to occupy this land while the main forces are busy defending against the Empire and the Barral Kingdom.<$FFFE>
Kill all intruders!<$FFFE>
Shika!<$FFFE>
It is a good thing that we came to see if everything was in order.<$FFFE>
The person in charge of this gate is a shrine maiden called Sophia, or so I've heard. I wonder what has happened to her.<$FFFE>
Crap!<$FFFC>
You think they captured her?<$FFFE>
Whatever the case is, we won't accomplish anything by simply standing here.<$FFFC>
First of all let us drive out those nuisances!<$FFFE>
Rise, Flame!<$FFFC>
Burn them all!<$FFFE>
Shikaaa!<$FFFE>
We are surrounded by flames!?<$FFFE>
Have you lost your mind!?<$FFFC>
At this rate we'll all be burnt to death!<$FFFE>
Do Kahni is Champion!<$FFFC>
We not fear fire!<$FFFE>
But I'm mighty scared right now!<$FFFE>
Sir [diehardt's name], we should make our way to the center.<$FFFE>
The central structure is surrounded by a moat.<$FFFC>
If we can make it to that area, the flames can't threaten us any longer.<$FFFE>
Throwing down all the enemies should also extinguish the fire, since it is of magical nature<$FFFE>
Either way will take time, we'll just have to rush forward and hope for the best.<$FFFE>
The fire is expanding, we have to get away from it fast.<$FFFC>
Everyone, throw down any resistance with utmost haste!<$FFFE>
Understood.<$FFFE>
The fire is still expanding.<$FFFC>
It could prove dangerous to try to throw down all the enemies.<$FFFE>
Understood.<$FFFD>
Everyone, break through the enemy lines and make your way to the gate!<$FFFC>
The flames won't reach us once we are there!<$FFFE>
Shika Shika!<$FFFC>
Scary! Scary!<$FFFE>
Powerful they are!<$FFFC>
But Do Kahni more powerful!<$FFFC>
Do Kahni never be defeated!<$FFFE>
The poor thing just doesn't know when to give up...<$FFFE>
Kill all, Shika!<$FFFE>
Shika Shika!<$FFFD>
God of Shika!<$FFFC>
Arekaschi curse all invaders!<$FFFC>
Shikashika!<$FFFE>
Shika shika!<$FFFE>
At the spot where the moon is being reflected in the water, something is sparkling in the water.<$FFFE>
What will you do?<$FFFE>
Jump into the water<$FFFE>
Reach out with your hand<$FFFE>
Throw 10P into the water<$FFFE>
Nothing special could be found.<$FFFE>
Nothing special could be found.<$FFFE>
There was no money...<$FFFE>
The water fairy appeared, asking you the following :<$FFFD>
"Did you just threw those jewels inside my lake?"<$FFFE>
Will you claim to have thrown the jewels?<$FFFE>
"Is that so?<$FFFC>
In that case you shall have them back."<$FFFE>
Brilliant Jewels were obtained!<$FFFD>
However, the jewels turn to simple stones right in front of your eyes...you liar...<$FFFE>
"You are an honest person,<$FFFC>
take this as a reward."<$FFFE>
Feathered Robe of the Goddess was obtained!<$FFFE>
Blasted!<$FFFC>
The flames...<$FFFE>
Here...<$FFFC>
would be good place to die for a knight...<$FFFE>
It's hot, so hot!<$FFFE>
What a shock!<$FFFC>
To be defeated like this....<$FFFE>
This certainly took me by surprise...<$FFFE>
Oh no!<$FFFE>
I fell into the enemies trap...<$FFFE>
The enemy got the better of me...<$FFFC>
My skill must have started to decay...<$FFFE>
Yaaaa!<$FFFC>
I cannot fight like this!<$FFFE>
Guaa!<$FFFE>
Oh my?<$FFFC>
My body is growing so hot...<$FFFE>
Oh my?<$FFFC>
My vision is growing dark...<$FFFE>
I...I'm so...sorry...<$FFFE>
Forgive me...<$FFFE>
Guuuaaarrgg!<$FFFE>
Shika Shika!<$FFFE>
I applaud you for your splendid commanding, Sir [diehardt's name].<$FFFE>
Sir [diehardt's name].<$FFFC>
Your commanding was something else... and I mean horrible..<$FFFD>
This will have negative effects for the next mission...<$FFFE>
The battle is over!<$FFFC>
The fire has extinguished as well, so let's get some information concerning the shrine maiden out of that fellow.<$FFFE>
Do Kahni is Champion of Shika tribe!<$FFFC>
I can not be defeated!<$FFFE>
