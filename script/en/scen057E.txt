I can't...lose....<$FFFE>
What have you done with the woman called Sophia, who used to live here?<$FFFE>
We kidnapped her.<$FFFC>
She's to be ritually sacrificed....<$FFFE>
Oh, no!<$FFFE>
A sacrifice!?<$FFFC>
Has it already happened!?<$FFFE>
The sacrifice will be at the next full moon.<$FFFE>
The next full moon will occur in three nights.<$FFFC>
Let's hurry.<$FFFE>
If we there are no wardens for the gates, it will be impossible to properly make use of their power.<$FFFE>
Excuse me!<$FFFC>
Sir [diehardt's name]?<$FFFE>
What is it?<$FFFE>
Lord Raymond dispatched us from his main force to come guard the southern gate!<$FFFE>
We need to hurry and reach the headquarters of the Shika Tribe.<$FFFC>
We'll entrust the defense of this gate to you!<$FFFE>
Yes, sir!<$FFFE>
All right, we've got no time to waste.<$FFFC>
Everyone, let's hurry on out!<$FFFE>
Plains Near the North Gate of the Lushiris Gate<$FFFF>
Do we have any news from the war front?<$FFFE>
The enemy seems a bit stronger than we thought, superior to our regular army, which is preventing us from making an attack.<$FFFE>
This brave general Bortz of the Empire is most impressive indeed.<$FFFE>
Worry not.<$FFFC>
He's just a minor headache we can crush when we return with our own army.<$FFFE>
It will only be a matter of time, after we come back.<$FFFE>
While these remnants of the Larcuss army seem fairly weak, that damned Lord Raymond is a force to be reckoned with.<$FFFE>
When he returns, we'll be in trouble.<$FFFC>
What to do....<$FFFE>
City of Laffel - Now Part of the Barral Kingdom<$FFFF>
S..so this is that so-called Grim Reaper, the Empire's skyboat fleet....<$FFFE>
Those foolish Barral soldiers have all scattered in disarray.<$FFFE>
Hmmph!<$FFFC>
So long as the Dark Knight stays absent, they have little true might to muster against us.<$FFFE>
I hadn't expected the Dark Knight to really stay absent.<$FFFE>
With Lord Gaiel leading us, we could take on even the Dark Knight....<$FFFE>
Looks like I didn't need that plan for him after all.<$FFFC>
Hohohoho!<$FFFE>
<$FFFF>
