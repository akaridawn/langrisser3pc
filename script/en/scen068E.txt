My humble apologies, Your Excellency Altem・ler.<$FFFE>
I am so ashamed that I have survived ignominiously after my attack of Lord Raymond.<$FFFE>
No, Bortz.<$FFFC>
I've heard the rumors.<$FFFE>
You chose your course of action to prevent our invaluable troops from being completely annihilated.<$FFFE>
Furthermore, your own troops have come to petition on your behalf.<$FFFC>
You don't need to fear me, just because I'm the Field Marshal.<$FFFE>
....I'd like it best if you retained your position, Bortz.<$FFFE>
Yes, sir!<$FFFE>
........<$FFFE>
What is it, Gaiel?<$FFFC>
How have you found the conquest of Laffel?<$FFFE>
...At first we were winning。  But, when the Dark Knight destroyed a number of our skyboats, I was devastated and ordered a retreat.....<$FFFE>
.....I see.<$FFFC>
So it was the Dark Knight, eh.<$FFFE>
On top of that, Gaiel.<$FFFC>
He managed to defeat even you.<$FFFE>
....I'm at a loss for words.<$FFFE>
He couldn't be beaten even with the power of the skyboat fleet....<$FFFC>
This Dark Knight is a most formidable foe.<$FFFE>
........<$FFFE>
It seems we'll need more military might than I'd initially suspected.<$FFFE>
I will return to the Imperial capitol to report the situation and request additional troops.<$FFFE>
If it is not too late, I would that I could begin the preparations for your entourage.<$FFFE>
That would be excellent, Varna.<$FFFE>
Gaiel, Bortz, Emaillink.<$FFFC>
I'm counting on you to watch over things in my absence!<$FFFE>
Yes, sir!<$FFFE>
Mountains Near the Western Gate<$FFFF>
Sir [diehardt's name]!<$FFFC>
A messenger has come!<$FFFE>
All right, have the messenger enter.<$FFFE>
Yes, sir!<$FFFE>
Ah, it's Miss Layla!<$FFFE>
It's been a while, [diehardt's name].<$FFFE>
It's good to see you again.<$FFFE>
I bring a message from Lord Raymond.<$FFFE>
Lord Raymond's main troops plan to fight against the Empire to keep them busy, while your mobile division searches for and then acquires the Haja no Ken.<$FFFE>
The Haja no Ken!?<$FFFE>
You've heard of it?<$FFFE>
Legend has it that in times long past, this sword was crafted in a foreign country far from here and instilled with the holy power to overcome evil.<$FFFE>
Even though the Lushiris Gate has been opened now, it seems that the strongest demons will still be able to enter.<$FFFE>
When they do, we need to have an effective way to defeat these demons, so.....<$FFFE>
The Haja no Ken, eh.....<$FFFE>
Who do you ask?<$FFFE>
Tiaris<$FFFE>
Riffany<$FFFE>
Luna<$FFFE>
Sophia<$FFFE>
Layla<$FFFE>
What do you think, Tiaris?<$FFFE>
Eh?<$FFFC>
I said, what do you think.....<$FFFD>
Like, we have to do this, right?<$FFFC>
So, let's, like, hurry up and get a move on!<$FFFE>
Gotcha.<$FFFE>
What do you think, Riffany?<$FFFE>
Why do you ask, [diehardt's name]-san?<$FFFC>
Well, you don't look all that eager to follow through with this.....<$FFFE>
No, that's not it....<$FFFD>
I'm just worried....if the demons' power is that strong.......<$FFFE>
What do you think, Luna?<$FFFE>
The Haja no Ken will become necessary to fight against the demons.<$FFFC>
That's why we must get ahold of it as quickly as possible.<$FFFE>
I see.<$FFFC>
Thanks, Luna.<$FFFE>
What do you think, Sophia?<$FFFE>
If unchecked, the demons will probably change our world into an even more terrible place.<$FFFC>
That's why we must do whatever we can to avert their victory.<$FFFD>
But, to do so, we must have the Haja no Ken.<$FFFE>
It's the only guaranteed way to defeat demons......<$FFFE>
What do you think, Miss Layla?<$FFFE>
Me?  Well, Lord Raymond asked me to come tell you to go and find the Haja no Ken, so.....<$FFFD>
Since the battle with the Empire is going to begin in earnest, and times are going to be hard, doesn't it seem necessary to get ahold of this thing?<$FFFE>
So, if we don't get ahold of it, we'll all be facing even bigger troubles, eh...<$FFFC>
That's how it seems, doesn't it?<$FFFC>
I see.  Well, let's head out.<$FFFE>
And that's why we should go and seek the Haja no Ken.<$FFFE>
All right, I'll trust your guidance!<$FFFE>
<$FFFC>
Scenario - 14<$FFFC>
"Fugitive Dios"<$FFFE>
Thanks to the work of [diehardt's name], the power of the four gates<$FFFC>
has been restored.  Furthermore, the Lushiris Gate now functions<$FFFC>
properly, radiating its holy light.<$FFFE>
While this protects against most demons, it will not be able to ward<$FFFC>
against the most powerful demons.  For that reason, the mobile<$FFFC>
division has been ordered to seek the Haja no Ken, to take<$FFFC>
advantage of its power over demons.<$FFFE>
As the party hurries on its way to fulfill these orders, they observe<$FFFC>
General Dios being pursued by the Barral army.<$FFFE>
*Condition for Victory<$FFFC>
 -Defeat of Flaire<$FFFC>
*Conditions for Defeat<$FFFC>
 -Death of [diehardt's name]<$FFFC>
 -Death of Dios<$FFFE>
