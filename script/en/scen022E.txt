Listen up!<$FFFD>
The aerial fortress hasn't arrived yet.<$FFFC>
Furthermore we are running low on supplies and replenishment.<$FFFD>
To put it plainly, the circumstances for this battle aren't ideal.<$FFFD>
But let none of that bother you and head into battle with all your heart!<$FFFC>
I have high expectations for you!<$FFFE>
Since we are waiting for the aerial fortress, wouldn't it be advisable to delay the enemy's advance with defensive tactics?<$FFFE>
Such tactics would require strong defensive capabilities.<$FFFD>
However, our mobile units would do rather poorly defending.<$FFFD>
They are much better suited to rush the enemy and trample them in one charge.<$FFFE>
Indeed.<$FFFC>
This battle formation will give us an advantage.<$FFFE>
The enemy!<$FFFC>
The enemy has come into sight!<$FFFE>
We're finally back!<$FFFE>
Although it has been only one year it feels like a very long time.<$FFFE>
You should contain that feelings for later.<$FFFE>
You'll have to defeat me if you wish to set foot into Larcussia.<$FFFE>
Emaillink!?<$FFFE>
You honestly believe you could stop us with so few troops?<$FFFE>
It's funny that you are telling me that one couldn't win with small numbers.<$FFFE>
Don't waste our time with chatter!<$FFFC>
Let us through; I must see my parents!<$FFFE>
So that's why.<$FFFC>
Not long ago Geier was chasing after the daughter of a noble family, that couldn't have been you?<$FFFE>
Anyhow, I'm afraid you won't be seeing your parents any time soon,  your road ends right here!!<$FFFE>
If we let ourselves being defeated, Larcussia's fertile lands will be lost.<$FFFD>
Let's give it our all today!<$FFFE>
Is there still no report concerning Geier's arrival? <$FFFE>
I'm afraid not.<$FFFE>
...I see.<$FFFE>
You there, is there still no report of the aerial fortresses's arrival!?<$FFFE>
My apologies, Sir!<$FFFE>
Curses, just how long are they planning to keep us waiting...<$FFFE>
Very well, begin the maneuver!<$FFFC>
Cavalry and Aerial units advance to disturb the enemy!<$FFFE>
Understood!<$FFFE>
Archers and Mages cover their advance!<$FFFE>
Leave it to us.<$FFFE>
Move out!<$FFFC>
Charge at them all at once!<$FFFE>
Diehärte.<$FFFC>
Is it true that you killed Bortz?<$FFFE>
What do you reply?<$FFFE>
He died an honorable death<$FFFE>
Say nothing<$FFFE>
He was no match for me<$FFFE>
His last moments where those of a true soldier.<$FFFC>
He was one of many good men we lost in this war.<$FFFE>
Well said.<$FFFD>
I'm sure he had no regrets having you as his opponent...<$FFFE>
....<$FFFE>
It was not my intention to drag personal emotions on the field of battle, but Bortz's killer must be punished.<$FFFE>
He was no match for me.<$FFFC>
It's laughable he was one of the four great generals.<$FFFE>
Bastard...<$FFFC>
You can insult me as much as you want, but I won't let you soil Bortz's name!<$FFFD>
In his name I will strike you lot down!<$FFFE>
There's a spot with no vegetation.<$FFFC>
It comes to your mind, that this could be a landmark of sorts.<$FFFE>
What do you do?<$FFFE>
Dig<$FFFE>
Pour water on the spot<$FFFE>
Thrust your sword into the ground<$FFFE>
Book of white magic was obtained!<$FFFE>
Suddenly a bush springs forth from the ground.<$FFFC>
It almost instantly bears one large fruit which splits up and gives birth to a rune like object.<$FFFE>
The forest rune was obtained!<$FFFE>
A breaking sound can be heard from underground.<$FFFE>
I couldn't...<$FFFC>
win....<$FFFE>
Father...<$FFFE>
I'm sorry everyone...<$FFFE>
I'm so sorry...<$FFFE>
Don't spoil my good mood!<$FFFE>
It's hopeless...<$FFFE>
Huh?<$FFFE>
Not again....<$FFFE>
Lushiris...<$FFFE>
Gurgh...<$FFFC>
Beware...the Jabberwock<$FFFE>
Grrr...<$FFFE>
I could have evaded if I wanted...<$FFFE>
Guargh!<$FFFC>
You'll go no further!<$FFFE>
Kuh, so that's it...<$FFFD>
This should have given the aerial fortress enough time to arrive...<$FFFD>
Fare well, Diehärte!<$FFFC>
This will be the last time you claim victory over me!<$FFFE>
Blasted...it seems I underestimated you...<$FFFE>
General Emaillink.<$FFFC>
Leave the rest to us.<$FFFD>
We will try to buy enough time for the aerial fortress to arrive.<$FFFE>
...That'd be good, thank you.<$FFFC>
I'm counting on you!<$FFFE>
Yes sir!<$FFFE>
Unconditionally we'll win.<$FFFD>
Larcussia is essential for the flourishing of the Empire.<$FFFC>
Now leave these lands and return nevermore!<$FFFE>
You're an eyesore to the Empire.<$FFFC>
You will die with me!<$FFFE>
Guaaww!<$FFFE>
Uuuuhh!<$FFFE>
Not now...<$FFFE>
Lord Emaillink....<$FFFE>
Charge!<$FFFE>
Uarrgh!<$FFFE>
Aaargh!<$FFFE>
Uuuh...<$FFFD>
Forgive me...general...Email..link...<$FFFE>
Kuh!<$FFFE>
This shouldn't be possible...<$FFFD>
Guhuu!<$FFFE>
Glory for the Rigüler Empire!<$FFFE>
Not like this!<$FFFE>
Why had it come to this...<$FFFE>
You can kill my body, but my ideals live on!<$FFFE>
Guaarr!<$FFFE>
I..wanted..to propose...tomorrow...<$FFFE>
To fly one more time...<$FFFE>
All my strength is leaving me...<$FFFE>
Uuugh!<$FFFE>
Chew on this!<$FFFE>
I'm powerless...<$FFFE>
Kyaaahh!<$FFFE>
Ouch...<$FFFE>
I wonder if one man could beat an army if his mind was truly set on it...<$FFFD>
...Hmph.<$FFFC>
I almost expected this outcome.<$FFFD>
Even so, Geier will have to take responsibility for this!<$FFFE>
The game is on, Diehärte!<$FFFC>
This time you won't be so lucky!<$FFFE>
This battle is won...<$FFFE>
You have yet to fail us, Diehärte.<$FFFE>
Well then, it is time to retake the castle.<$FFFE>
Sir Diehärte...<$FFFC>
That was pretty slow, we might be in trouble,<$FFFD>
because of you slacking off...<$FFFE>
Understood.<$FFFC>
We will hurry onward to the castle.<$FFFE>
It's over...<$FFFC>
Well then, it is time to retake the castle.<$FFFE>
<$FFFF>
